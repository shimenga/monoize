# Request Capture Viewer Specification

## 0. Status

- **Purpose:** Expose persisted request-capture dumps (`request-capture-dumps.spec.md`) to dashboard users through a per-request detail API and a capture viewer dialog on the logs page.
- **Scope:** Dashboard API `GET /api/dashboard/request-captures/{request_id}`, the `has_capture` indicator on request-log list rows, and the frontend capture viewer UI.
- **Compatibility:** Applies only to version-2 dumps that have a `request_capture_records` row. Version-1 dumps written before this feature have no metadata row and are not viewable (RCD-D2a).

## 1. Logs list capture indicator

RCV-L1. Every request-log row returned by `GET /api/dashboard/request-logs` MUST include `has_capture: boolean`.

RCV-L2. `has_capture` MUST be `true` iff at least one `request_capture_records` row exists with `request_id = row.request_id AND user_id = row.user_id`. The list query MUST compute this with an indexed `EXISTS` subquery (or an equivalent indexed lookup) against `request_capture_records` only. The list path MUST NOT open, stat, or read any dump file.

RCV-L3. In-memory SSE snapshots (`request-logs.spec.md` RL1a-1, FL46) are emitted before capture persistence completes, so SSE-delivered rows MUST carry `has_capture: false`.

RCV-L4. Because of RCV-L3, while SSE is connected the logs page MUST schedule one trailing-debounced newest-page SWR revalidation (debounce interval 1500 ms) whenever at least one SSE-delivered row with a terminal status (`success`, `error`, `client_gone`) arrives. This revalidation refreshes `has_capture` without user interaction. Pending-only SSE batches MUST NOT schedule it.

## 2. Capture detail API

### 2.1 Endpoint

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/dashboard/request-captures/{request_id}`
- **Authorization:** Any authenticated dashboard user; per-record access rules in section 2.2.
- **Query parameters:**
  - `user_id: string?` — optional owner filter. When present, only capture records with that `user_id` are considered. Access rules are unchanged by this parameter.

RCV-A1. The handler MUST resolve candidate records by `request_id` (and `user_id` when supplied) from `request_capture_records`, ordered by `created_at_unix_ms DESC`, then `file_name DESC`.

RCV-A2. The handler MUST select the first candidate record the caller is authorized to view (section 2.2) and serve that record's dump file.

RCV-A3. The dump file MUST be read from disk on demand, only inside this handler. The read MUST occur on a blocking-capable executor.

RCV-A4. Success response body:

```json
{
  "request_id": string,
  "file_name": string,
  "created_at": "RFC3339 string",
  "size_bytes": integer,
  "owner": { "id": string, "username": string | null },
  "dump": object
}
```

`dump` is the parsed dump-file JSON after section 2.3 redaction.

### 2.2 Access rules

RCV-A5. A caller with role `user` is authorized only for records whose `user_id` equals the caller's user id.

RCV-A6. A caller with role `admin` or `super_admin` is authorized for a record iff:

1. the record's `user_id` equals the caller's user id, or
2. the record's owner user row exists and has role `user`.

An admin-role caller is therefore never authorized for another `admin`'s or `super_admin`'s records, and a record whose owner row was deleted is authorized only for its own user id.

RCV-A7. When no candidate record exists, or no candidate record is authorized, the endpoint MUST return HTTP `404` with code `capture_not_found`. Denied and absent captures MUST be indistinguishable in status code, error code, and message.

RCV-A8. When the selected record's dump file no longer exists on disk, the handler MUST delete that stale `request_capture_records` row, then continue with the next authorized candidate; if none remains, it MUST return the RCV-A7 response.

RCV-A9. When the dump file exists but is not parseable JSON, the endpoint MUST return HTTP `500` with code `capture_dump_unreadable`.

### 2.3 Transform-chain redaction

RCV-A10. When the caller's role is `user`, the handler MUST rewrite each attempt in `dump.attempts[]` before responding:

- `transform_chain` (when it is an array) MUST retain only entries with `scope == "api_key"`,
- the attempt MUST gain `hidden_transforms: integer` equal to the number of removed entries.

RCV-A11. When the caller's role is `admin` or `super_admin`, `transform_chain` MUST be returned unmodified and `hidden_transforms` MUST be `0` when the field is emitted.

RCV-A12. Redaction applies uniformly to own and foreign captures: it depends only on the caller's role.

## 3. Frontend entry point

RCV-F1. The logs table first column merges time and request id (`request-logs.spec.md` FL8): line 1 is `created_at`, line 2 is the request-id fragment with its status indicator.

RCV-F2. For rows with `has_capture == true`, line 2 of the first column MUST additionally render one square icon button, right-aligned within the column, using the lucide-react `ScanSearch` glyph. Rows with `has_capture != true` MUST NOT render the button.

RCV-F3. The button MUST have an accessible localized label (`requestLogs.capture.open`), a minimum 24x24 px hit target inside the dense table row, and MUST be reachable by keyboard.

RCV-F4. Activating the button MUST open the capture viewer dialog for that row, passing the row's `request_id` and `user.id`.

## 4. Capture viewer dialog

### 4.1 Data fetching

RCV-F5. The capture dump MUST be fetched through an SWR hook keyed by `(request_id, user_id)`. The SWR key MUST be `null` while the dialog is closed, so no fetch occurs before the dialog opens. Closing the dialog keeps the cache entry; reopening the same row MUST reuse the cached dump per normal SWR semantics.

RCV-F6. While the fetch is loading, the dialog body MUST render a skeleton fallback. A fetch error MUST render a localized error state with a retry action; it MUST NOT render an empty body.

### 4.2 Structure

RCV-F7. The dialog MUST use the shared `Dialog` primitive so it inherits the popup motion contract (`frontend-popup-motion.spec.md` PM3-PM13) without page-level animation code.

RCV-F8. The dialog header MUST show, when available: the full `request_id` (monospace), dump `created_at`, downstream protocol, stream/non-stream badge, and — when more than one attempt exists — an attempt selector listing `attempt_number`, provider id, and upstream model per attempt. Selecting an attempt switches all section 4.3 content to that attempt.

RCV-F9. The dialog MUST show a compact transform-chain strip for the selected attempt: one chip per `transform_chain` entry, in stored order, showing the transform id, with scope and phase distinguishable (label or badge styling). When `hidden_transforms > 0`, the strip MUST append one localized chip stating the number of hidden system transforms. When `transform_chain` is `[]` or `null` and `hidden_transforms` is absent or `0`, the strip MUST render a localized empty label.

RCV-F10. The content area MUST be a tab bar with exactly these tabs for the selected attempt:

1. **Downstream request** (`raw_input`) — the request body received from the client,
2. **Upstream request** (`upstream_request`) — the body actually sent upstream,
3. **URP** (`transformed_urp_request`) — the transformed intermediate request,
4. **Response** — `downstream_response` when non-null, otherwise the `downstream_sse_frames` list, otherwise the attempt `error` object, otherwise a localized empty state.

RCV-F11. Each tab MUST provide a copy button that copies the tab's full underlying content to the clipboard: pretty-printed JSON (2-space indent) for object tabs, newline-joined frame data for the SSE tab. Copy success MUST show transient localized feedback.

### 4.3 Content rendering

RCV-F12. JSON content MUST render as a collapsible tree with token-level syntax coloring using existing theme tokens: keys in the info color family, strings in the success color family, numbers in the warning color family, booleans and null in muted/destructive styling. All payload text MUST use the monospace font.

RCV-F13. The tree MUST support multi-level collapse: every object and array node with children is independently toggleable. Nodes at depth >= 3, arrays with more than 20 entries, and object values with more than 50 keys MUST start collapsed. Collapsed nodes MUST show a summary (`{…} n keys` / `[…] n items`).

RCV-F14. A string leaf longer than 400 characters MUST render truncated with a localized expand/collapse control; expanding never mutates the underlying data.

RCV-F15. Expand/collapse transitions MUST use non-linear easing from the project motion tokens (`easeOutExpo` enter, `easeInOutQuart` exit) via `framer-motion`; durations MUST be within `0.16s`-`0.30s`. Linear easing MUST NOT be used.

RCV-F16. The SSE frames view MUST render one row per captured frame, monospace, each row independently expandable when its content exceeds one line, with the frame index visible. When the attempt records frame truncation (`downstream_sse_frames_truncation.truncated == true`), the list MUST show a localized truncation notice with the omitted counts.

### 4.4 Responsiveness and accessibility

RCV-F17. On viewports narrower than the `sm` breakpoint, the dialog MUST occupy at least 92% of viewport width and its content area MUST remain vertically scrollable; tab triggers MUST remain reachable without horizontal viewport overflow.

RCV-F18. On `sm` and wider viewports, the dialog width MUST be capped (max-w-4xl) with an internal scroll area, per `frontend-popup-motion.spec.md` PM14.

RCV-F19. Tabs, the attempt selector, copy buttons, and collapse toggles MUST be operable by keyboard, and interactive controls MUST have accessible names.

## 5. Localization

RCV-F20. All user-facing strings introduced by this feature MUST use i18n keys under `requestLogs.capture.*` with translations in `en`, `ja`, `zh`, and `zh-TW`.
