# Monoize URP v2 Transform System Specification

## 0. Status

- Version: `2.0.0`
- Product name: Monoize
- Internal protocol name: `URP v2`
- Scope: flat URP v2 request and response transform surfaces, flat decode and encode behavior, flat streaming transform behavior, cross-family nested passthrough stripping, and routing integration.

## 1. URP v2 Core Contract

URPTF-1. This specification extends `spec/urp-v2-flat-structure.spec.md`. If the two files disagree about the meaning of a URP v2 request, response, node, control node, or stream event, `spec/urp-v2-flat-structure.spec.md` is authoritative for structure and this file is authoritative for transform execution.

URPTF-2. Internal request representation for transforms MUST be `UrpRequestV2 { model, input, ... }` where `input` is an ordered flat `Vec<Node>`.

URPTF-3. Internal response representation for transforms MUST be `UrpResponseV2 { id, model, output, ... }` where `output` is an ordered flat `Vec<Node>`.

URPTF-4. `Message { role, parts }` is not a URP v2 value and MUST NOT appear in canonical request storage, canonical response storage, transform-visible payload surfaces, or canonical stream terminal state.

URPTF-5. Transform-visible payload surfaces are only these surfaces:
1. typed top-level request and response fields plus top-level `extra_body`;
2. ordinary top-level nodes in `request.input` and `response.output`;
3. top-level `ToolResult` nodes and their nested `ToolResultContent` entries;
4. top-level control nodes;
5. canonical URP v2 stream events and terminal `ResponseDone.output`.

URPTF-6. A transform MUST operate on URP v2 values only. A transform MUST NOT require access to raw downstream wire payloads, raw upstream wire payloads, or decoder-private grouped helper state.

URPTF-7. Transform execution MUST remain stateless. A transform MUST NOT resolve persisted conversation state or `previous_response_id`; same-Responses forwarding and routing affinity may carry those native fields under `spec/unified_responses_proxy.spec.md` S2 through S3a without exposing resolved conversation state to transforms.

## 2. Decode and encode requirements for transforms

DEC-1. Downstream requests from `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, and `/v1/messages` MUST decode into `UrpRequestV2` before any request-phase transform executes.

DEC-2. Downstream responses and upstream responses MUST decode into `UrpResponseV2` before any response-phase non-stream transform executes.

DEC-3. Stream decoders MUST emit canonical URP v2 stream events before any response-phase stream transform executes.

DEC-4. Unknown wire fields that belong to top-level request or response objects MUST decode into top-level `extra_body`.

DEC-5. Unknown wire fields that belong to one ordinary node, one `ToolResult`, or one `ToolResultContent` entry MUST decode into that exact owner's `extra_body`.

DEC-6. Unknown wire fields that belong to one downstream or upstream envelope rather than to one emitted ordinary node or `ToolResult` MUST decode as `next_downstream_envelope_extra` control nodes under the URP v2 flat structure rules.

DEC-7. Tool calls MUST decode as ordinary `ToolCall` nodes.

DEC-8. Tool execution output MUST decode as top-level `ToolResult` nodes. A decoder MUST NOT represent tool execution output as an ordinary role-bearing node.

DEC-9. Reasoning data from upstream or downstream wire formats MUST decode as ordinary `Reasoning` nodes, using the typed `encrypted` field when the provider requires opaque reasoning passthrough data.

ENC-1. Upstream request construction MUST encode from URP v2 values only.

ENC-2. URP v2 to upstream encoding MUST support provider types `responses`, `chat_completion`, `messages`, `gemini`, and `openai_image`.

ENC-3. If one `Reasoning` node carries both opaque reasoning payload in `encrypted` and plaintext fields in `content` and/or `summary`, an adapter MAY omit the plaintext fields only when the target wire format requires opaque reasoning exclusivity for that same reasoning node.

ENC-4. An adapter MUST NOT drop one `Reasoning` node solely because a different `Reasoning` node in the same flat node sequence carries `encrypted`.

ENC-5. Model rewrite MUST apply provider `models[requested].redirect` when present; otherwise the requested model name remains the upstream model.

ENC-6. Logical downstream envelope reconstruction belongs only to the encoder. A decoder or transform MUST NOT reintroduce canonical grouped-message storage under different terminology.

ENC-7. ProviderItem replay is same-protocol only. An encoder MUST replay `ProviderItem.body` only when `ProviderItem.origin_protocol` exactly equals the target provider protocol. On mismatch, the encoder MUST omit the ProviderItem and MUST NOT convert it to text or prompt content.

ENC-8. When encoding a `ToolCall` node, Monoize MUST rewrite JSON numbers in `arguments` that are finite integer-valued floats and that equal an `i64` after conversion as JSON integers. Precondition: `arguments` parses as JSON. Postcondition: those numbers appear without a fractional part (`4338.0` becomes `4338`). Monoize MUST leave non-JSON `arguments`, non-finite numbers, non-integer-valued numbers, and numbers outside the `i64` range unchanged. This rewrite MUST apply to:

1. non-stream downstream and upstream `arguments` / `input` / `args` fields;
2. stream `response.function_call_arguments.done` and `response.custom_tool_call_input.done` payloads;
3. stream `response.output_item.done` function-call items;
4. a `NodeDelta::ToolCallArguments` payload that is itself a complete JSON document.

The rewrite is unconditional. It does not require a transform rule.

### 2.1 Cross-family nested passthrough stripping

XSTRIP-1. Protocol family names and cross-family hop semantics are defined by `spec/urp-v2-flat-structure.spec.md`.

XSTRIP-2. Cross-family nested passthrough stripping applies only to nested passthrough state. Top-level request and response `extra_body` are not nested and MUST remain intact across all hops.

XSTRIP-3. When the downstream protocol family differs from the upstream provider type, and cross-family stripping is enabled for that provider attempt, the runtime MUST perform stripping after downstream request decoding and before provider request-phase transforms execute.

XSTRIP-4. The stripping pass in XSTRIP-3 MUST do all of the following on `UrpRequestV2.input`:
1. remove every non-internal member from `extra_body` on every ordinary node;
2. remove every non-internal member from `extra_body` on every top-level `ToolResult` node;
3. remove every non-internal member from `extra_body` on every nested `ToolResultContent` entry; and
4. remove every `next_downstream_envelope_extra` control node.

A decoder-created or transform-created `_monoize_` member is internal semantic provenance under `spec/urp-v2-flat-structure.spec.md` XTRA-10, not nested wire passthrough. The stripping pass MUST retain it until the target adapter consumes or discards it. No target encoder may emit that reserved member as a wire field.

XSTRIP-5. After XSTRIP-4, later provider request-phase transforms MAY add new target-family nested passthrough state.

XSTRIP-6. On a same-family hop, the runtime MUST preserve node-local `extra_body`, `ToolResult.extra_body`, `ToolResultContent.extra_body`, and control nodes.

XSTRIP-7. Cross-family stripping enablement MUST be controlled by these settings in descending precedence:
1. provider-level override `strip_cross_protocol_nested_extra` when present;
2. global setting `monoize_strip_cross_protocol_nested_extra` otherwise.

XSTRIP-8. Resolution semantics for XSTRIP-7 are exact:
1. provider override `Some(true)` means strip on every cross-family hop for that provider attempt;
2. provider override `Some(false)` means never strip for that provider attempt; and
3. provider override `None` means inherit the global setting.

XSTRIP-9. ProviderItem filtering is independent of cross-family nested passthrough stripping. For every upstream attempt, before provider request-phase transforms run, the runtime MUST remove from `UrpRequestV2.input` every `ProviderItem` whose `origin_protocol` differs from the selected upstream provider protocol. This filtering runs even when XSTRIP-7 disables cross-family nested passthrough stripping.

## 3. Canonical streaming representation for transforms

STR-1. Response-phase stream transforms MUST operate on canonical URP v2 stream events only.

STR-2. The transform-visible canonical event set is: `ResponseStart`, `NodeStart`, `NodeDelta`, `NodeDone`, `ResponseDone`, and `Error`.

STR-3. `NodeDone.node` MUST contain the complete terminal node for that `node_index`.

STR-4. `ResponseDone.output` MUST contain the complete terminal ordered flat `Vec<Node>`.

STR-5. `ResponseDone.output` is the authoritative final streamed response state for downstream stream reconstruction, synthetic terminal event synthesis, and all post-stream transform reasoning.

STR-6. Pass-through streaming MUST use the architecture `upstream SSE -> decoder -> URP v2 stream event channel -> transform pipeline -> downstream encoder`.

STR-7. If an upstream streaming protocol emits opaque reasoning payload incrementally, the stream decoder MUST emit ordered `NodeDelta` events that preserve that opaque payload before terminal `NodeDone` and `ResponseDone` reconstruction. A downstream stream encoder or transform MUST NOT rely on terminal reconstruction alone to surface opaque reasoning data during pass-through streaming.

STR-8. The transform engine MUST support incremental stream processing with per-request mutable transform state.

STR-9. If a streaming request matches at least one enabled response-phase transform rule that requires whole-response mutation rather than incremental URP v2 stream rewriting, or if the selected downstream streaming protocol cannot faithfully represent that transform's incremental output, the runtime MAY execute the upstream attempt in non-stream mode, apply response transforms to `UrpResponseV2`, and emit synthesized downstream streaming events. Buffered synthetic timing is allowed in that mode.

STR-10. A stream transform MAY rewrite `NodeStart`, `NodeDelta`, `NodeDone`, and `ResponseDone`, but it MUST preserve a valid canonical node lifecycle unless the runtime switches to the buffered synthetic path in STR-9.

## 4. Transform system

TF-1. A transform MUST implement these conceptual interface members:
- `type_id()`
- `display_name()`
- `display_description()`
- `supported_phases()`
- `supported_scopes()`
- `config_schema()`
- `parse_config()`
- `init_state()`
- `apply()`

TF-1b. `display_name()` and `display_description()` MUST return localized-text entries as `(language, text)` pairs satisfying TF-8a.

TF-1a. Request-phase and response-phase transform execution MUST support asynchronous work. The runtime MAY await file I/O, local computation, or other asynchronous operations performed by `apply()` before continuing to the next matching rule.

TF-2. Persisted `TransformRuleConfig` MUST include `transform`, `enabled`, `models`, `phase`, and `config`.

TF-3. Transform rule execution MUST be ordered. The output of rule `i` MUST be the input to rule `i + 1` within the same phase and scope chain.

TF-4. A rule is eligible to execute only when all conditions below hold:
1. `enabled = true`;
2. the rule phase equals the current phase; and
3. if `models` is present, at least one model glob matches the normalized logical model.

TF-4a. Model glob matching is case-sensitive and anchored to the full model string.
`*` matches any sequence of zero or more characters. `?` matches exactly one
character. Every other pattern character matches only itself. Both wildcards
match every Unicode scalar value, including newline. Matching MUST NOT compile
a regular expression per evaluation; evaluation cost MUST be bounded by
O(len(pattern) x len(model)) without heap-allocated per-call pattern
translation.

TF-5. Transform registry discovery MUST be automatic through `inventory`.

TF-6. Adding a new transform file with a valid inventory submission MUST be sufficient for registration.

TF-7. Built-ins that MUST exist are exactly:
- `cache_anthropic_auto`
- `cache_anthropic_system`
- `cache_anthropic_tool_use`
- `cache_openai_prompt`
- `cache_openai_tool_use`
- `cache_prefix_stabilize`
- `cache_user_id`
- `field_alias_reserved_tool_names`
- `field_custom_tools_to_function`
- `field_override_max_tokens`
- `field_remove`
- `field_set`
- `field_strip_sampling`
- `image_compress_input`
- `image_compress_output`
- `image_enable_openai_generation_tool`
- `image_markdown_to_output`
- `image_output_to_markdown`
- `image_resolve_urls`
- `prompt_append_empty_user`
- `prompt_inject_system`
- `prompt_strip_anthropic_billing_header`
- `prompt_strip_orphaned_tool_calls`
- `reasoning_content_to_summary`
- `reasoning_effort_to_budget`
- `reasoning_effort_to_model_suffix`
- `reasoning_from_think_xml`
- `reasoning_inject_content_field`
- `reasoning_strip_config`
- `reasoning_strip_encrypted`
- `reasoning_strip_input`
- `reasoning_strip_output`
- `reasoning_summary_heading`
- `reasoning_summary_to_raw_cot`
- `reasoning_to_think_xml`
- `role_assistant_image_to_user`
- `role_developer_to_system`
- `role_merge_consecutive`
- `role_system_to_developer`
- `stream_force`
- `stream_split_sse_frames`

TF-SCR1. `reasoning_strip_config` applies in the request phase. Applying it MUST set
`UrpRequest.reasoning` to none; it MUST NOT alter input nodes, tools, or sampling. It has no
configuration and no state. Its purpose is upstream compatibility: an upstream that rejects
carried thinking configuration (for example `requires adaptive thinking`) receives a plain
non-thinking request.

TF-7a. Every canonical transform ID MUST take the form `<domain>_<subject>` where `<domain>` is the first `_`-separated segment and MUST be one of exactly these seven values:
1. `cache` — provider prompt-cache optimization;
2. `field` — direct mutation of typed request/response fields or `extra_body` paths;
3. `image` — image payload conversion, compression, generation-tool control, and URL resolution;
4. `prompt` — request `input` node-sequence hygiene (insertion, padding, line stripping, orphan removal);
5. `reasoning` — reasoning representation, placement, and effort conversion;
6. `role` — ordinary-node role rewriting and role-based merging;
7. `stream` — stream execution mode and downstream SSE framing.

TF-7b. Transforms that form a conversion or inverse pair MUST use mirrored IDs inside one domain, using exactly one of these shapes:
1. `<domain>_<a>_to_<b>` paired with `<domain>_<b>_to_<a>` (example: `role_system_to_developer` / `role_developer_to_system`);
2. `<domain>_to_<x>` paired with `<domain>_from_<x>` (example: `reasoning_to_think_xml` / `reasoning_from_think_xml`);
3. a shared `<domain>_<verb>` prefix with differing final segments (examples: `field_set` / `field_remove`, `reasoning_strip_input` / `reasoning_strip_output`, `image_compress_input` / `image_compress_output`, `image_markdown_to_output` / `image_output_to_markdown`, `cache_anthropic_tool_use` / `cache_openai_tool_use`).

TF-8. Every transform registry item returned by `/api/dashboard/transforms/registry` MUST include `type_id`, `supported_phases`, `supported_scopes`, `config_schema`, `name`, and `description`.

TF-8a. `name` and `description` MUST each be a JSON object mapping a lowercase language code to a non-empty human-readable string. Both objects MUST contain at least the keys `en` and `zh`. For built-in transforms the values MUST come from the transform's `display_name()` and `display_description()` interface members; the registry endpoint MUST NOT synthesize display text from `type_id`. For custom `js:` transforms the plain-string name and description are mirrored into both keys per `spec/custom-js-transforms.spec.md` CJS-REG-2.

TF-8c. After SAC-1 authorization (`spec/security-access-control.spec.md`), the registry response additionally contains one item per enabled custom `js:` transform, shaped per `spec/custom-js-transforms.spec.md` CJS-REG-1 and CJS-REG-2. Visibility filtering of custom rules for non-admin API-key callers is defined in CJS-AKV-2.

TF-8b. A `config_schema` string property MAY carry `"format": "multiline"` to request a multi-line text editor in the dashboard (see `transform-config-ui.spec.md` TCU-3 rule 4). Exactly these properties MUST carry `"format": "multiline"`: `prompt_inject_system` property `content`, `prompt_append_empty_user` property `content`, and `image_output_to_markdown` property `template`.

TF-9. Scope semantics are exact:
1. `provider` means the transform MAY be configured in provider transform chains;
2. `global` means the transform MAY be configured in the system settings global transform chain;
3. `api_key` means the transform MAY be configured in API-key transform chains;
4. a transform MAY support more than one scope; and
5. dashboard editors MUST hide transforms that do not support the current editor scope.

TF-10. The runtime context passed to a transform MUST include `upstream_provider_type`.

TF-11. For request-phase transforms, `upstream_provider_type` MUST equal the selected provider type for the current attempt after model routing and API-type override resolution.

TF-12. For response-phase non-stream and stream transforms, `upstream_provider_type` MUST equal the provider type that produced the decoded upstream response or stream.

TF-13. When no upstream provider is selected for a transform invocation, `upstream_provider_type` MUST be absent.

TF-14. Canonical transform IDs MUST match `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*$`.

TF-15. Runtime transform lookup MUST canonicalize transform IDs before resolving the registry entry. After canonicalization, resolution consults the built-in registry first and the enabled custom-transform snapshot second, per `spec/custom-js-transforms.spec.md` CJS-RT-2. A rule whose id starts with `js:` and does not resolve MUST be skipped as a no-op (CJS-RT-3); every other unresolved id keeps the not-found error behavior.

TF-16. On startup, the application MUST canonicalize transform IDs persisted in:
1. `system_settings` row `key = "global_transforms"`;
2. `monoize_providers.transforms`; and
3. `api_keys.transforms`.

TF-17. The canonicalization map MUST map exactly these historical IDs to canonical IDs:

| historical ID | canonical ID |
| --- | --- |
| `auto_cache_openai` | `cache_openai_prompt` |
| `auto_cache_openai_prompt` | `cache_openai_prompt` |
| `auto_cache_openai_prompt_key` | `cache_openai_prompt` |
| `auto_cache_openai_tool_use` | `cache_openai_tool_use` |
| `auto_cache_system` | `cache_anthropic_system` |
| `auto_cache_tool_use` | `cache_anthropic_tool_use` |
| `auto_cache_user_id` | `cache_user_id` |
| `append_empty_user_message` | `prompt_append_empty_user` |
| `assistant_markdown_images_to_output` | `image_markdown_to_output` |
| `assistant_output_images_to_markdown` | `image_output_to_markdown` |
| `compress_assistant_output_images` | `image_compress_output` |
| `compress_user_message_images` | `image_compress_input` |
| `developer_to_system_role` | `role_developer_to_system` |
| `enable_openai_image_generation_tool` | `image_enable_openai_generation_tool` |
| `force_stream` | `stream_force` |
| `inject_system_prompt` | `prompt_inject_system` |
| `merge_consecutive_roles` | `role_merge_consecutive` |
| `openai_prompt_cache` | `cache_openai_prompt` |
| `override_max_tokens` | `field_override_max_tokens` |
| `plaintext_reasoning_to_summary` | `reasoning_content_to_summary` |
| `reasoning_content_delta` | `reasoning_inject_content_field` |
| `remove_anthropic_billing_header` | `prompt_strip_anthropic_billing_header` |
| `remove_anthropic_billing_headers` | `prompt_strip_anthropic_billing_header` |
| `remove_field` | `field_remove` |
| `set_field` | `field_set` |
| `split_sse_frames` | `stream_split_sse_frames` |
| `strip_anthropic_billing_header` | `prompt_strip_anthropic_billing_header` |
| `strip_anthropic_billing_headers` | `prompt_strip_anthropic_billing_header` |
| `strip_claude_code_billing_header` | `prompt_strip_anthropic_billing_header` |
| `strip_encrypted_reasoning` | `reasoning_strip_encrypted` |
| `strip_input_reasoning` | `reasoning_strip_input` |
| `strip_orphaned_tool_use` | `prompt_strip_orphaned_tool_calls` |
| `strip_reasoning` | `reasoning_strip_output` |
| `system_to_developer_role` | `role_system_to_developer` |
| `think_xml_to_reasoning` | `reasoning_from_think_xml` |

TF-17a. An ID already equal to a canonical ID in TF-7 MUST map to itself. An ID absent from both TF-7 and the TF-17 table MUST remain unchanged.

TF-18. Provider transform-rule id canonicalization MUST use the persistent `system_settings` marker `migration.provider_transform_rule_ids.v2`. When the marker value is `complete`, startup MUST perform only the marker point query and MUST NOT scan `monoize_providers`. When the marker is absent, startup MUST scan Provider transform rows in `id ASC` keyset batches of at most `199`. Each batch read and its set-based CASE update MUST commit in one transaction before the next batch; process memory MUST remain `O(199)`. After every batch commits, startup MUST write the completion marker in a separate final transaction. That final transaction MUST also delete the obsolete `system_settings` row `key = "migration.provider_transform_rule_ids.v1"`. Invalid transform JSON MUST remain unchanged and MUST NOT prevent the completion marker.

### 4.1 Transform-visible request and response surfaces

SURF-1. Request-phase transforms MAY read and write typed top-level request fields and top-level request `extra_body`.

SURF-2. Request-phase transforms MAY read and write ordinary nodes in `request.input`.

SURF-3. Request-phase transforms MAY read and write top-level `ToolResult` nodes and their nested `ToolResultContent` entries in `request.input`.

SURF-4. Request-phase transforms MAY read, remove, preserve, or insert control nodes only when this specification defines that behavior explicitly for the named transform. Otherwise control nodes are opaque sequence elements and MUST remain byte-for-byte unchanged.

SURF-5. Response-phase transforms MAY read and write typed top-level response fields and top-level response `extra_body`.

SURF-6. Response-phase transforms MAY read and write ordinary nodes in `response.output`.

SURF-7. Response-phase transforms MAY read and write top-level `ToolResult` nodes and nested `ToolResultContent` entries in `response.output` when the transform's target surface includes those nodes explicitly.

SURF-8. Response-phase stream transforms MAY read and write canonical stream events and terminal `ResponseDone.output`.

SURF-9. Unless a transform section below says otherwise, a transform MUST treat `ToolResult` as outside ordinary role-based rewrite and merge semantics.

SURF-10. Unless a transform section below says otherwise, a transform MUST treat `next_downstream_envelope_extra` as an opaque boundary marker rather than as user-visible content.

### 4.2 Role and sequence transforms on ordinary nodes

ROLE-1. `role_system_to_developer` is request-phase only.

ROLE-2. `role_system_to_developer` MUST rewrite `role = system` to `role = developer` on ordinary nodes in `request.input`.

ROLE-3. `role_system_to_developer` MUST NOT modify `ToolResult` nodes, `ToolResultContent` entries, or control nodes.

ROLE-4. `role_developer_to_system` is request-phase only.

ROLE-5. `role_developer_to_system` MUST rewrite `role = developer` to `role = system` on ordinary nodes in `request.input`.

ROLE-6. `role_developer_to_system` MUST NOT modify `ToolResult` nodes, `ToolResultContent` entries, or control nodes.

ROLE-7. `role_merge_consecutive` is request-phase only.

ROLE-8. `role_merge_consecutive` MUST operate on a derived contiguous-run view of adjacent ordinary nodes in `request.input`. It MUST NOT introduce grouped canonical storage.

ROLE-9. Within one maximal run of adjacent ordinary nodes, `role_merge_consecutive` MAY merge neighboring ordinary nodes only when all conditions below hold:
1. both nodes are ordinary nodes;
2. both nodes carry the same ordinary `role`;
3. neither node is `Reasoning` or `ToolCall` if the downstream encoder treats those node kinds as distinct top-level semantic units;
4. no `ToolResult` node lies between them; and
5. no control node lies between them.

ROLE-10. If `role_merge_consecutive` merges neighboring ordinary nodes, it MUST preserve node order and MUST preserve all surviving typed fields. If conflicting nested passthrough keys survive on merged ordinary-node state, the earlier surviving node's typed fields remain authoritative and merge policy for residual passthrough keys MUST be deterministic.

ROLE-11. `role_merge_consecutive` MUST NOT merge `ToolResult` into ordinary nodes and MUST NOT cross a control-node boundary.

ROLE-10a. Text nodes with a signature, token scores, or citations MUST remain separate during `role_merge_consecutive`. The transform MUST preserve their text and metadata without merging adjacent text into them.

TXT-M1. If `reasoning_from_think_xml` finds no configured opening tag in an assistant text node, it MUST preserve that node unchanged in non-stream output and terminal stream output.

TXT-M2. When `image_output_to_markdown` appends image Markdown to existing text, it MUST clear that text node's signature and token scores. Existing citation ranges remain valid because the original text prefix is unchanged.

Motivation for ROLE-12 through ROLE-19: some chat-completion upstreams accept an image part carried on an assistant message at the wire level but silently drop it before the model sees it, so the model answers as if the conversation contained no image. Relocating such images onto a following user message keeps the image visible to the model.

ROLE-12. `role_assistant_image_to_user` is request-phase only and supports the provider, global, and api-key scopes.

ROLE-13. The transform MUST select exactly the `Image` nodes in `request.input` whose ordinary `role = assistant`. It MUST NOT select `Text`, `Audio`, `File`, `ToolCall`, `Reasoning`, `ToolResult`, or control nodes, and MUST NOT select `Image` nodes whose role differs from `assistant`.

ROLE-14. For each selected image node, the transform MUST compute an insertion anchor: the index of the first node in `request.input` that is an ordinary node with `role = user` and whose index is strictly greater than the selected node's index. The anchor search MUST skip nodes of every other kind, including `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, and control nodes. For this rule, ordinary nodes are exactly the `Text`, `Image`, `Audio`, `File`, and `ProviderItem` node kinds.

ROLE-15. If an anchor exists, the transform MUST remove the selected image node from its original position, set its `role = user`, set its `id` to absent, and insert it immediately before the anchor node. Selected images that share one anchor MUST be inserted at that anchor in their original relative order.

ROLE-16. If no anchor exists for a selected image node, the transform MUST remove the node from its original position, set its `role = user`, set its `id` to absent, and append it at the end of `request.input`. Selected images without an anchor MUST be appended in their original relative order.

ROLE-17. The transform MUST NOT modify the `source` or `extra_body` of a selected node, MUST NOT modify any non-selected node, and MUST NOT reorder non-selected nodes relative to each other.

ROLE-18. The transform MUST be idempotent: applying it to its own output yields the same node sequence.

ROLE-19. `role_assistant_image_to_user` MUST accept an empty config object and MUST reject any config object that contains any key.

### 4.3 `prompt_append_empty_user`

AEUM-1. Phase: request only.

AEUM-2. Config MAY contain `content` as a string. Default value is one single-space string.

AEUM-3. The transform MUST inspect the final element of `request.input`.

AEUM-4. If the final element is an ordinary node with `role = assistant`, the transform MUST append one ordinary `Text` node with `role = user` and `content = config.content`.

AEUM-5. If `request.input` is empty, or if the final element is not an ordinary assistant node, the transform MUST be a no-op.

AEUM-6. `prompt_append_empty_user` MUST NOT append `ToolResult` nodes, MUST NOT append control nodes, and MUST NOT inspect derived grouped-message wrappers.

### 4.4 `prompt_inject_system`

ISP-1. Phase: request only.

ISP-2. Config MUST contain `content: string` and `position: "prepend" | "append"`.

ISP-3. `prompt_inject_system` targets only ordinary `Text` nodes with `role = system` in `request.input`.

ISP-4. If `position = prepend`, the transform MUST locate the first ordinary `Text` node with `role = system` and append the configured text to that node's `content` as an additional system text segment under the encoder's later grouping rules. If no such node exists, the transform MUST insert one new ordinary `Text` node with `role = system` at the beginning of `request.input`.

ISP-5. If `position = append`, the transform MUST locate the last ordinary `Text` node with `role = system` and append the configured text to that node's `content` as an additional system text segment under the encoder's later grouping rules. If no such node exists, the transform MUST append one new ordinary `Text` node with `role = system` to the end of `request.input`.

ISP-6. `prompt_inject_system` MUST NOT rewrite `ToolResult` nodes, `ToolResultContent`, or control nodes.

ISP-7. If a control node lies at the target insertion boundary, the inserted system text node MUST be placed as an ordinary sequence element without consuming or modifying the control node.

### 4.5 `prompt_strip_orphaned_tool_calls`

SOTU-1. Phase: request only.

SOTU-2. `prompt_strip_orphaned_tool_calls` MUST collect the set of `call_id` values from top-level `ToolResult` nodes in `request.input`.

SOTU-3. The transform MUST remove every ordinary `ToolCall` node in `request.input` whose `call_id` does not appear in the collected `ToolResult` set.

SOTU-4. `prompt_strip_orphaned_tool_calls` MUST NOT remove `ToolResult` nodes.

SOTU-5. `prompt_strip_orphaned_tool_calls` MUST preserve all non-`ToolCall` ordinary nodes unchanged.

SOTU-6. `prompt_strip_orphaned_tool_calls` MUST preserve control nodes unchanged.

### 4.5a `stream_force`

FS-1. `stream_force` is request-phase only.

FS-2. Config MUST contain `enabled` as a boolean.

FS-3. If `enabled = true`, the transform MUST set `request.stream = true` during request-phase application.

FS-4. If `enabled = false`, the transform MUST set `request.stream = false` during request-phase application.

FS-5. When `stream_force` is configured in a provider transform chain for a provider whose effective upstream type is `openai_image`, and the downstream request is non-streaming, Monoize MUST still request the upstream image endpoint in streaming mode, collect the upstream stream into one `UrpResponseV2`, apply response transforms, and return a normal non-streaming downstream response. This follows `openai-image-upstream.spec.md` §6.

FS-6. `stream_force` MUST NOT modify `request.input`, `request.tools`, `request.tool_choice`, or any response-phase payload surface.

### 4.5b `field_set`

SF-1. `field_set` MUST support request-phase and response-phase execution.

SF-2. Config MUST contain `path` as a non-empty string and `value` as any JSON value. Config MAY contain `when_equals` as any JSON value.

SF-3. If `when_equals` is absent, `field_set` MUST write `value` at `path` without inspecting the current value.

SF-3a. JSON `null` is a present `when_equals` value. It MUST NOT be treated as absent. When `when_equals` is JSON `null`, `field_set` MUST write `value` only when the current value at `path` is JSON `null`.

SF-4. If `when_equals` is present, `field_set` MUST write `value` only when the current value at `path` is exactly equal to `when_equals` under JSON structural equality. A missing path or a different value MUST be a no-op and MUST NOT create intermediate objects.

SF-5. On a request, a recognized `reasoning.*` path MUST target the corresponding typed `ReasoningConfig` field. Supported typed controls include effort, summary, mode, budget_tokens, and display. Unknown reasoning paths target `request.reasoning.extra_body`. Every other path targets `request.extra_body`. Setting or removing a typed field MUST NOT leave a stale native override. Conditional equality MUST compare the typed value for recognized paths.

SF-6. On a non-stream response, `path` MUST target `response.extra_body`. On a stream event, `path` MUST target the event `extra_body`.

SF-7. A Provider request transform with config `{ "path": "service_tier", "when_equals": "priority", "value": "fast" }` MUST replace only the exact JSON string `"priority"`. The transform MUST preserve an absent value and every other JSON value.

### 4.5c `field_alias_reserved_tool_names`

ARTN-1. `field_alias_reserved_tool_names` MUST support request-phase and response-phase execution. Supported scopes are `provider`, `global`, and `api_key`.

ARTN-2. Config MAY contain `aliases` as a JSON object mapping original function names to alias names. If `aliases` is absent, the transform MUST use the default map `{ "view_image": "client_view_image" }`. If `aliases` is present, including an empty object, the transform MUST use that object and MUST NOT add the default map.

ARTN-3. Every alias key and value MUST be a non-empty JSON string. A value that is not a string, an empty key, an empty value, a mapping from a name to itself, two keys that map to the same alias, or an alias that equals any original key MUST fail config parsing as `InvalidConfig`.

ARTN-4. Request-phase application MUST replace each original name with its alias on:
1. `request.tools[]` entries whose `type` is `function` or `custom`, including `name`, `function.name`, and `custom.name`;
2. `request.input` `ToolCall` node `name` fields;
3. `request.tool_choice` when it is a JSON object or array, by replacing any object member `name` whose string value is an original name.

ARTN-5. Request-phase application MUST NOT rename tools whose `type` is neither `function` nor `custom`. Built-in descriptors such as `type = "web_search"` MUST keep their names.

ARTN-6. Response-phase application MUST replace each alias with its original name on:
1. non-stream `response.output` `ToolCall` node `name` fields;
2. stream `NodeStart` headers of kind `ToolCall`;
3. stream `NodeDone` nodes of kind `ToolCall`;
4. stream `ResponseDone.output` `ToolCall` node `name` fields.

ARTN-7. A `ToolCall` whose name is not in the active map MUST remain unchanged. A native upstream tool that still uses an original reserved name therefore MUST NOT be rewritten to the client name.

ARTN-8. An empty alias map MUST be a no-op in both phases.

### 4.5d `field_custom_tools_to_function`

CTF-1. `field_custom_tools_to_function` MUST support request-phase and response-phase execution. Supported scopes are `provider`, `global`, and `api_key`.

CTF-2. Config MAY contain `names` as a JSON array of non-empty strings. If `names` is absent, the transform MUST use `["apply_patch"]`. If `names` is present, including an empty array, the transform MUST use that array and MUST NOT add the default. An empty-string entry MUST fail config parsing as `InvalidConfig`.

CTF-3. If `names` contains the exact string `"*"`, the transform MUST convert every `type = "custom"` tool descriptor. Other `names` entries remain additional exact-name matches.

CTF-4. An empty `names` array and no `"*"` MUST be a no-op in both phases.

CTF-5. Request-phase application MUST convert each matching tool in `request.tools[]` whose `type` is `custom` into a `type = "function"` descriptor with:
1. `function.name` equal to the custom tool name;
2. `function.description` equal to the custom tool description when present, otherwise a non-empty apply_patch instruction string. When the converted tool name is `apply_patch`, the transform MUST append an apply_patch usage suffix if that suffix is not already present. The suffix MUST state that existing files use `*** Update File` with `@@` hunks, unchanged hunk lines start with one space, `-` deletes, `+` inserts, a hunk MUST NOT consist of identical `-` and `+` line bodies with no extra `+` or `-` line, and an existing file MUST NOT be rewritten as `*** Add File`;
3. `function.parameters` equal to a JSON object schema with required string property `input`;
4. `custom` absent.

CTF-6. Request-phase application MUST convert each matching `request.input` `ToolCall` node with `tool_type = custom` to `tool_type = function`. If `arguments` is not already a JSON object containing string key `input`, the transform MUST replace `arguments` with the JSON object `{"input": <original arguments string>}`.

CTF-7. Request-phase application MUST rewrite `request.tool_choice` JSON so that an object member `type` whose string value is `custom` becomes `function` when the same object has `name` matching CTF-2/CTF-3.

CTF-8. Response-phase application MUST convert each matching `ToolCall` with `tool_type = function` to `tool_type = custom` on:
1. non-stream `response.output`;
2. stream `NodeStart` headers of kind `ToolCall`;
3. stream `NodeDone` nodes of kind `ToolCall`;
4. stream `ResponseDone.output`.

CTF-9. When converting a function `ToolCall` back to custom, if `arguments` parses as a JSON object with a string field `input`, `patch`, `command`, or `content`, the transform MUST replace `arguments` with that string. Prefer `input`. Prefer `patch`/`command`/`content` only when the string contains `Begin Patch` or the key is `input`. If `arguments` is not such a JSON object, the transform MUST keep the original string.

CTF-10. On stream `NodeDelta::ToolCallArguments`, if the current `arguments` value unwraps under CTF-9 to a different string, the transform MUST replace that delta's `arguments` with the unwrapped string.

CTF-11. Native descriptors whose `type` is neither `custom` nor `function` MUST remain unchanged.

CTF-12. After CTF-8 and CTF-9, for a matching `apply_patch` `ToolCall` (whether originally custom or converted from function), the transform MUST rewrite `arguments` so that:
1. a first line that starts with `*** Begin Patch` becomes exactly `*** Begin Patch`;
2. a line that starts with `*** End Patch` becomes exactly `*** End Patch`;
3. lines equal to `*** End of File` or `*** End of File ***` are removed;
4. if the payload is wrapped in an `<invoke ...>...</invoke>` element, the inner text is used before rules 1–3.
5. after a line that starts with `*** Add File`, prefix `+` on each following content line if and only if all of these hold: the line does not start with `***`; the line is not a `@@` hunk header after trimming; the line does not already start with `+`, `-`, or `\`. A `@@` hunk header, a line that starts with `*** Update File` or `*** Delete File`, and a `*** End of File` line (including when rule 3 removes it) MUST end this Add File prefixing section. The prefix MUST NOT be applied inside `*** Update File` or `*** Delete File` sections. A line that already starts with `+`, `-`, or `\` MUST remain unchanged.
6. after rules 1–5, each `*** Update File` hunk whose `-` line bodies equal its `+` line bodies and that contains no context line (a line that does not start with `+`, `-`, `\`, or `@@`) MUST be removed. If an Update File section then has no remaining hunk, the whole section MUST be removed.

### 4.6 Image transforms on request ordinary nodes

EOIGT-1. `image_enable_openai_generation_tool` is request-phase only.

EOIGT-2. Config MAY contain:
- `output_format` as one of `png`, `webp`, or `jpeg`; default `png`;
- `action` as a string; optional;
- `force_stream` as a boolean; default `false`; and
- `force_tool_choice` as a boolean; default `false`; and
- `extra` as an object whose entries supply defaults in the inserted tool descriptor's typed `config`.

EOIGT-3. The transform MUST inspect only top-level `request.tools`.

EOIGT-4. If `request.tools` is absent, the transform MUST create it as a one-element array containing one tool descriptor with `type = "image_generation"`.

EOIGT-5. If `request.tools` already contains an `image_generation` descriptor, the transform MUST NOT append another descriptor.

EOIGT-5a. Existing tool configuration MUST retain its values. With `force_stream = true`, the transform MAY supply the missing `partial_images` default defined by EOIGT-6a.

EOIGT-6. When the transform inserts a tool descriptor, it MUST set:
1. `type = "image_generation"`;
2. `config` from the configured `extra` object, preserving its JSON values;
3. `config.output_format = <configured output_format>`;
4. `config.action = <configured action>` only when `action` is configured; and
5. `config.partial_images = 3` when EOIGT-6a permits that default.

EOIGT-6a. With `force_stream = true`, the transform MUST set `request.stream = true`. It MUST default `config.partial_images` to `3` only when the request and tool omit that field.

EOIGT-6b. Explicit `partial_images` values, including `0`, MUST override the transform default.

EOIGT-6c. Typed `request.image_generation` values MUST remain authoritative. The Responses encoder MUST project them into each compatible `image_generation` tool after transform defaults.

EOIGT-6d. The transform MUST NOT create a second copy of typed image request values in adapter extras.
When typed image options are absent, the transform MUST lift recognized image controls from `request.extra_body` into `request.image_generation`.
It MUST preserve a boolean top-level `background` as a Responses control.
When typed image options exist, the transform MUST remove duplicate image controls from extras without restoring absent typed values.

EOIGT-7. The transform MUST preserve the source order of existing tools. It MUST append an inserted tool after them.

EOIGT-8. If `force_stream = true`, the transform MUST set `request.stream = true` during request-phase application. This rule applies even when `request.tools` already contains an `image_generation` descriptor.

EOIGT-9. If `force_stream = false`, the transform MUST NOT modify `request.stream`.

EOIGT-10. If `force_tool_choice = true`, the transform MUST set `request.tool_choice` to a specific Responses native tool choice object equivalent to `{ "type": "image_generation" }` during request-phase application.

EOIGT-11. If `force_tool_choice = false`, the transform MUST NOT modify `request.tool_choice`.

EOIGT-12. The transform MUST NOT modify `request.input` or any response-phase payload surface.

EOIGT-13. The Responses encoder MUST map typed image settings into `image_generation` tool configuration, for inserted and existing tools.
Supported settings are `size`, `quality`, `background`, `output_format`, `output_compression`, `moderation`, `partial_images`, and `input_fidelity`.
These values MUST override same-named tool defaults and MUST NOT appear as image controls at the Responses request top level.
An ordinary Responses `background` boolean MUST retain its top-level meaning.

EOIGT-14. If `request.image_generation` is present without a compatible `image_generation` tool, Responses encoding MUST return an error before the upstream request.
The encoder MUST NOT inject a tool or permit a text-only request to replace an Images request.

EOIGT-15. Responses encoding MUST reject explicit image `style`, `n` other than `1`, and `response_format` other than `b64_json`.
Images ingress fan-out owns multiple outputs. Responses image tools return Base64 data and cannot fulfill a requested hosted URL.

EOIGT-16. A request image with typed `metadata.image_mask = true` MUST become `image_generation.config.input_image_mask`.
Base64 sources MUST use a data URL in `image_url`. URL sources MUST use `image_url`. File references MUST use `file_id`.
Existing media validation and provider provenance checks MUST run before this mapping.

EOIGT-17. The encoder MUST exclude mask nodes from ordinary Responses input.
It MUST reject multiple masks, non-user masks, masks without a source image, and masks without a compatible image generation tool.
The typed mask MUST override any configured `input_image_mask` value.

CUMI-1. `image_compress_input` is request-phase only.

CUMI-2. Config MAY contain:
- `max_edge_px` (integer, optional)
- `jpeg_quality` (integer, default `80`)
- `jpegxl_quality` (integer from `1` through `99`, default `90`)
- `jpegxl_effort` (integer from `1` through `10`, default `7`)
- `webp_quality` (integer from `1` through `100`, default `80`)
- `skip_if_smaller` (boolean, default `true`)
- `output_format` (`original`, `jpg`, `jpegxl_lossless`, `jpegxl`, `webp_lossless`, `webp`, or `png`; default `original`)

When `max_edge_px` is absent, the transform MUST preserve the decoded image dimensions. When it is present, it MUST be at least `1`, and the transform MUST resize the decoded image only when its width or height exceeds that value.

CUMI-3. The transform MUST inspect ordinary `Image` nodes with `role = user`, `ToolResultContent::Image` entries in request `ToolResult` nodes, and complete JSON arguments of function `ToolCall` nodes. Custom-tool freeform input MUST remain unchanged.

CUMI-3a. If any user image or tool-result image has typed `metadata.image_mask = true`, the transform MUST leave every request image source unchanged. This check MUST precede cache lookup, decoding, resizing, and format conversion.

CUMI-4. Eligible image sources are:
1. `Image.source = Base64`; or
2. `Image.source = Url` whose `url` is a `data:<image-media-type>;base64,<payload>` URL.

CUMI-4a. In a function `ToolCall.arguments` JSON value, the transform MUST inspect complete `data:<image-media-type>;base64,<payload>` string values and `source = { type: "base64", media_type, data }` inside objects with `type = "image"`, `"input_image"`, `"output_image"`, or `"image_url"`. It MUST apply CUMI-4 through CUMI-12 to those image sources, preserve other object fields and array order, and serialize the JSON only if a source changes. Invalid JSON, other strings, custom-tool input, and non-image base64 objects MUST remain unchanged.

CUMI-5. Non-`data:` URL sources MUST remain unchanged.

CUMI-6. If the media type is not decodable by the image codec stack, the node MUST remain unchanged.

CUMI-6a. For an eligible source within the encoded-byte limit, the transform MUST detect JPEG, PNG, or WebP from the source bytes. The detected format MUST determine `output_format = original` and the cache key. If `skip_if_smaller` retains a decoded image, the transform MUST replace a mismatched declared media type with the detected media type. It MUST preserve the image bytes and source representation. If the source exceeds a CUMI-12 limit or fails image decoding, the transform MUST leave it unchanged. A source without a detected JPEG, PNG, or WebP format retains its existing behavior.

CUMI-7. On successful replacement:
1. `Base64` sources MUST remain `Base64` with updated `media_type` and `data`;
2. `data:` URL sources MUST remain `Url` with updated `url`;
3. tool-call JSON carriers MUST retain their original shape with only image MIME and bytes changed; and
4. typed image metadata and provider-specific fields such as image detail hints MUST remain unchanged.

CUMI-8. When `output_format = original`, the transform MUST use the detected format from CUMI-6a when available. Otherwise, it MUST use the declared supported format. It MUST normalize the `image/jpg` alias to `image/jpeg`. Source WebP MUST use the `webp_lossless` encoder path. When `output_format` is any other configured value, the transform MUST emit the explicitly selected image format, except as required by CUMI-8a. The exact encoder modes are:
1. `jpg` uses the mozjpeg fastest profile with `jpeg_quality`;
2. `jpegxl_lossless` uses the reference libjxl encoder in lossless mode with `jpegxl_effort`;
3. `jpegxl` uses the reference libjxl encoder in lossy mode with `jpegxl_quality` mapped through `JxlEncoderDistanceFromQuality` and `jpegxl_effort`;
4. `webp_lossless` uses lossless WebP encoding;
5. `webp` uses lossy libwebp encoding with `webp_quality`; and
6. `png` uses PNG best compression followed by lossless PNG optimization.

Both JPEG XL modes MUST emit media type `image/jxl`. Both WebP modes MUST emit media type `image/webp`.

CUMI-8b. The default Cargo feature set MUST include `jpegxl`. A build without
that feature MUST compile without linking libjxl. An attempted JPEG XL encode
in that build MUST return `TransformError::Apply` with message
`jpeg xl support is disabled in this build`. Other image formats retain their
specified behavior. With the feature enabled, each encoder MUST use
`MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_JXL_THREADS`, parsed according to RRB-C1 with default 4,
as its native worker count.

CUMI-8a. If the decoded source has an alpha channel and the selected output format is `jpg`, the transform MUST leave the image source unchanged. This rule applies even when all alpha samples are opaque. It takes precedence over `max_edge_px` and `skip_if_smaller`. The transform MUST preserve the original encoded bytes, media type, dimensions, and source representation. Formats that support alpha MUST continue to use CUMI-8. Cached results created before this rule MUST NOT replace the source.

CUMI-9. The cache key material MUST be the ordered byte sequence:
1. UTF-8 bytes of `compress_user_message_images:v7` (a version-frozen cache-key literal; version 7 excludes cached results that predate CUMI-6a);
2. one zero byte;
3. UTF-8 bytes of the source media type after CUMI-6a normalization;
4. one zero byte;
5. `max_edge_px` encoded as little-endian `u32`, using `0` when it is absent;
6. `jpeg_quality` encoded as one byte;
7. `jpegxl_quality` encoded as one byte;
8. `jpegxl_effort` encoded as one byte;
9. `webp_quality` encoded as one byte;
10. `skip_if_smaller` encoded as one byte, where `true = 1` and `false = 0`;
11. UTF-8 bytes of `output_format`;
12. one zero byte; and
13. the decoded original image bytes.

CUMI-10. The cache key MUST be SHA-256 over the cache key material, formatted as 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters.

CUMI-11. Cache persistence, eviction, and failure isolation MUST apply equally to eligible ordinary, tool-result, and tool-call image sources.

CUMI-12. The decoded source payload MUST be bounded before allocation and image decode. Defaults are 20971520 encoded bytes and 40000000 pixels, configured by `MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_MAX_ENCODED_BYTES` and `MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_MAX_PIXELS`. A source exceeding either limit MUST remain unchanged.

CUMI-13. Concurrent blocking image transformations MUST be limited by a semaphore. The default permit count is 2, configured by `MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_MAX_CONCURRENCY`.

CUMI-14. The content cache root defaults to `${TMPDIR}/monoize/image-transform-cache` and is configured by `MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_CACHE_DIR`. Cache entries expire after 3600 seconds by default; `MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` configures a positive expiration interval in seconds. The cache defaults to at most 2048 regular entry files, 536870912 total entry bytes, and 33554432 bytes per entry. These limits are configured by `MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_CACHE_MAX_FILES`, `MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`, and `MONOIZE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM_CACHE_MAX_ENTRY_BYTES`. Writes MUST validate cache keys, use unique same-directory temporary files, and use atomic rename. Startup MUST remove transform-owned stale temporary files. Before admitting a write, cleanup MAY evict oldest entries to remain within both file and byte quotas.

CUMI-15. Cache construction MUST scan the cache directory once, delete expired or invalid entries, evict oldest entries until startup file/byte quotas hold, and build a bounded in-memory metadata index containing key, byte count, modification time, and LRU sequence. Point reads and writes MUST use that index and MUST NOT rescan the cache directory. A point read MUST verify the indexed file's current size before allocating its contents. Point reads MUST update LRU order. A stale point-read observation MUST NOT delete a concurrently published replacement for the same key; validation and deletion MUST serialize with replacement or perform equivalent identity revalidation. Writes MUST evict through the ordered metadata index and MUST update metadata only after atomic rename succeeds. A deletion failure MUST leave metadata accounting intact and fail that cleanup/write operation. Periodic cleanup MAY traverse the bounded metadata index and MUST NOT rescan the directory.

RIU-1. `image_resolve_urls` supports request and response phases. It MUST process request input, non-streaming response output, stream `NodeDone` image nodes, and stream `ResponseDone.output`. Other stream events remain unchanged.

RIU-2. Config MAY contain:
- `timeout_seconds` (integer, default `30`)
- `max_bytes` (integer, default `20971520`)
- `roles` (string array of ordinary roles, optional)

RIU-3. The transform MUST inspect only ordinary `Image` nodes whose `role` is in the configured role set, or all ordinary roles when `roles` is absent.

RIU-4. The transform MUST inspect only `Image.source = Url` whose `url` does not start with `data:`.

RIU-5. On successful fetch, the transform MUST replace the source with `Image.source = Base64 { media_type, data }` using standard base64 encoding.

RIU-6. Multiple eligible image fetches within one request MUST be concurrent.

RIU-7. A failed fetch for one image node MUST NOT block other eligible image nodes and MUST leave the failed node unchanged.

RIU-8. Successful URL resolutions MUST be reused within one rule execution state so terminal stream replay does not download the same image again. Resolution MUST preserve node identity, role, and metadata. The byte limit MUST be enforced while reading the response body, before extending the buffer beyond the limit.

### 4.7 Reasoning transforms on flat nodes and stream state

PRTS-1. `reasoning_content_to_summary` is response-phase only.

PRTS-2. Config MUST be an empty object.

PRTS-3. On non-stream responses, the transform MUST inspect only ordinary `Reasoning` nodes.

PRTS-4. If a `Reasoning` node carries non-empty plaintext `content`, the transform MUST move that value into `summary` and clear `content`.

PRTS-5. PRTS-4 applies whether or not the same `Reasoning` node also carries `encrypted`.

PRTS-6. If a `Reasoning` node already has `summary`, the moved plaintext `content` value MUST replace the previous `summary`.

PRTS-7. The transform MUST preserve `encrypted`, `source`, and node-local `extra_body`. When it moves plaintext content, it MUST set typed `metadata.summary_as_thinking = true`.

PRTS-8. Empty plaintext content MUST NOT create a non-empty summary.

PRTS-9. On streams, if the transform moves non-empty `NodeDelta.delta.content` into `NodeDelta.delta.summary`, it MUST set `NodeDelta::Reasoning.metadata.summary_as_thinking = true` on that same stream event. The marker means the summary delta was originally raw plaintext reasoning and MAY be emitted by a downstream Messages encoder as incremental `thinking_delta`.

PRTS-10. PRTS-9 MUST NOT be applied to terminal `NodeDone.node.extra_body` or `ResponseDone.output[].extra_body`. Terminal correctness is defined by `NodeDone.node` and `ResponseDone.output` after applying PRTS-4 through PRTS-8 to `Reasoning` nodes.

RSRC-1. `reasoning_summary_to_raw_cot` is response-phase only.

RSRC-2. Config MUST be an empty object.

RSRC-3. On non-stream responses, the transform MUST inspect only ordinary `Reasoning` nodes.

RSRC-4. If a `Reasoning` node carries non-empty `summary`, the transform MUST select the typed reasoning presentation option for the Chat reasoning_content alias. It MUST NOT create an unknown wire field or copy the summary string.

RSRC-5. The transform MUST NOT modify `content`, `summary`, or `encrypted`.

RSRC-6. On streams, the transform MUST set `NodeDelta::Reasoning.metadata.chat_content = true` when summary is non-empty. It MUST apply the same typed marker to final reasoning nodes in `NodeDone.node` and `ResponseDone.output`.

RSRC-7. A downstream Chat encoder MUST honor the typed reasoning_content presentation option using the current typed summary or content. The option MUST NOT relabel a summary as raw CoT in canonical storage.

RCD-1. `reasoning_inject_content_field` is response-phase only.

RCD-2. Config MUST be an empty object.

RCD-3. For each ordinary `Reasoning` node or reasoning `NodeDelta`, the transform MUST resolve a plaintext `reasoning_content` value as follows:
1. use non-empty `content` if present;
2. otherwise use non-empty `summary` if present; and
3. otherwise resolve no value.

RCD-4. `encrypted` MUST NOT contribute to the resolved value.

RCD-5. If a resolved value exists on a terminal `Reasoning` node, the transform MUST select a typed reasoning_content alias option. It MUST NOT retain a second text copy.

RCD-6. If a resolved value exists on a reasoning `NodeDelta`, the transform MAY select the corresponding typed presentation option on the delta.

RCD-7. If a reasoning node or delta carries only encrypted reasoning and no plaintext `content` or `summary`, the transform MUST inject nothing.

RCD-8. The transform MUST be independent of `reasoning_summary_to_raw_cot`. Both transforms MAY be enabled simultaneously.

RCD-9. A downstream Chat encoder MUST emit a selected reasoning_content alias from current typed text without removing normal reasoning fields. Internal presentation controls MUST NOT appear on the wire.

SER-1. `reasoning_strip_encrypted` is response-phase only. Supported scopes are `provider`, `global`, and `api_key`.

SER-2. Config MUST be an empty object.

SER-3. On non-stream responses, the transform MUST clear `Reasoning.encrypted` and MUST remove `encrypted_content` from `Reasoning.extra_body` for every ordinary `Reasoning` node in `response.output`.

SER-4. On non-stream responses, the transform MUST remove `encrypted_content` from any `next_downstream_envelope_extra` control node whose `extra_body` either contains `encrypted_content` or carries `type = "reasoning"`.

SER-5. On streams, the transform MUST apply the following per canonical event:
1. on a `NodeStart` whose `header.type = reasoning`, remove `encrypted_content` from the event's `extra_body`;
2. on a `NodeStart` whose `header.type = next_downstream_envelope_extra` and whose `extra_body` carries reasoning-item state under SER-4, remove `encrypted_content` from the event's `extra_body`;
3. on a `NodeDelta` whose `delta.type = reasoning`, clear `delta.encrypted`;
4. on a `NodeDone` whose `node.type = reasoning`, apply SER-3 to `node`;
5. on a `NodeDone` whose `node.type = next_downstream_envelope_extra` and whose `extra_body` carries reasoning-item state under SER-4, apply SER-4 to `node`;
6. on a `ResponseDone`, apply SER-3 and SER-4 to every node in `output`.

SER-6. The transform MUST preserve plaintext reasoning surfaces. Specifically, `Reasoning.content`, `Reasoning.summary`, `Reasoning.source`, and node-local `extra_body` keys other than `encrypted_content` MUST remain unchanged. On reasoning `NodeDelta`, fields `content`, `summary`, and `source` MUST remain unchanged.

SER-7. The transform MUST be a no-op on `UrpData::Request`. Request-side stripping of replayed encrypted reasoning is governed by `spec/unified_responses_proxy.spec.md` PR4c.6 through PR4c.8 and is not the responsibility of this transform.

SER-8. The transform MUST behave identically whether the encrypted payload it observes is an `mz2.` envelope string or a raw upstream encrypted reasoning value. PIPE-1d guarantees that when `reasoning_envelope_enabled = true`, only the envelope form is observable; this transform MUST NOT depend on that guarantee for correctness.

SER-8a. The transform MUST clear typed `ToolCall.signature` in non-stream responses, `NodeHeader::ToolCall.signature` on `NodeStart`, and terminal tool-call signatures in `NodeDone` and `ResponseDone`. It MUST preserve tool-call arguments and other fields.

SER-9. The motivating use case for SER-1 through SER-8 is downstream SSE clients that cannot tolerate single SSE `data:` lines exceeding their per-line buffer. Removing `encrypted_content` shrinks the per-line payload of `response.output_item.done` and `response.completed` events without changing other observable response semantics.


RSH-1. `reasoning_summary_heading` is response-phase only. Supported scopes are `provider`, `global`, and `api_key`.

RSH-2. Config MUST be an object whose allowed properties are exactly:
1. `default_title`: string; default `"Thinking"`;
2. `derive_title`: boolean; default `false`;
3. `max_title_chars`: integer; default `64`; minimum `1`.
A parsed `max_title_chars` value of `0` MUST be `InvalidConfig`. Additional properties MUST be rejected.

RSH-3. Title sanitization MUST apply to `default_title` at config parse time and to any derived title at apply time, in this order:
1. trim;
2. replace each `\n` and each `\r` with a single space;
3. remove every `*` character;
4. if the Unicode scalar count exceeds `max_title_chars`, truncate to the first `max_title_chars` Unicode scalars; if that truncated span contains any whitespace, truncate instead at the last whitespace in the span;
5. trim;
6. if the result is empty, use `"Thinking"`.

RSH-4. A summary string has a heading if and only if, after `trim()`, all of the following hold:
1. the string starts with `**`;
2. a later `**` closes a non-empty inner title;
3. the character immediately after that closing `**` is `\n` or `\r`.
Mid-string `**emphasis**` that is not followed by `\n` or `\r` MUST NOT count as a heading.

RSH-5. When the transform inserts a heading, the resulting summary MUST equal `**` + sanitized title + `**` + `\n\n` + the original summary body. The original body MUST NOT be trimmed or otherwise rewritten.

RSH-6. The transform MUST NOT insert a heading when `summary` is missing or equal to the empty string.

RSH-7. Title selection MUST be:
1. first non-empty reasoning `NodeDelta.summary` for a node: sanitized `default_title`; partial delta text MUST NOT be used as a title;
2. complete `summary` text with no prior summary delta for that node (`UrpResponse`, `NodeDone` with no earlier summary delta, and `ResponseDone`): a derived title if `derive_title` is true, otherwise sanitized `default_title`;
3. complete `summary` text after a live heading prefix was already applied to that node: sanitized `default_title`; a different derived title MUST NOT replace the live heading.

RSH-8. When `derive_title` is true and RSH-7 selects a derived title, the candidate MUST be produced as follows from the original unprefixed complete summary:
1. trim;
2. if a `.`, `!`, `?`, `\n`, or `\r` occurs after the first Unicode scalar, take the prefix before the first such scalar;
3. otherwise take the full trimmed string;
4. sanitize that candidate with RSH-3.

RSH-9. The transform MUST inspect only ordinary `Reasoning.summary` and reasoning `NodeDelta.summary`. It MUST NOT move `content`. It MUST NOT modify `encrypted` or `source`.

RSH-10. Operators who need plaintext `content` copied into `summary` MUST enable `reasoning_content_to_summary` earlier in the same response-phase chain. This transform MUST NOT compose that move internally.

RSH-11. On non-stream `UrpResponse`, the transform MUST apply RSH-4 through RSH-8 to every ordinary `Reasoning.summary` in `response.output`.

RSH-12. The transform MUST keep per-stream state keyed by `node_index` with:
1. `summary_delta_seen`: a non-empty reasoning `NodeDelta.summary` was observed for that node;
2. `heading_prefixed`: that node already received a heading prefix, including the case where the first non-empty delta already satisfied RSH-4.

RSH-13. On the first non-empty reasoning `NodeDelta.summary` for a node:
1. if the delta has no heading under RSH-4, prefix sanitized `default_title` using RSH-5;
2. mark `summary_delta_seen` and `heading_prefixed`.
Later summary deltas for that node MUST remain unchanged.

RSH-14. On a `NodeDone` whose `node.type = reasoning`:
1. format `node.summary` with RSH-4 through RSH-8;
2. if the formatted `summary` is non-empty and `summary_delta_seen` is false, `finalize_stream_event` MUST emit a `NodeDelta::Reasoning` whose `summary` is the formatted full text, then the mutated `NodeDone`;
3. the injected delta MUST copy `source` and typed reasoning metadata from the node, set `metadata.item_id` from the node ID when present, and leave `content` and `encrypted` unset.
The replacement vector MUST include both events. The pipeline MUST ignore the original event when replacement is `Some`.

RSH-15. On `ResponseDone`, the transform MUST format every `Reasoning.summary` with RSH-4 through RSH-8. It MUST NOT inject events on `ResponseDone`.

RSH-16. On `UrpData::Request`, the transform MUST be a no-op.

RSH-17. Applying the transform to a summary that already satisfies RSH-4 MUST leave that summary unchanged. A second apply MUST NOT add a second heading.


### 4.8 Response image transforms on flat ordinary nodes and stream state

AMIO-1. `image_markdown_to_output` is response-phase only.

AMIO-2. Config MUST be an empty object.

AMIO-3. The transform MUST inspect only ordinary assistant `Text` nodes.

AMIO-4. The transform MUST recognize Markdown image syntax `![alt](url)` inside those text-node contents.

AMIO-5. Recognized ordinary URLs MUST become ordinary assistant `Image` nodes with `Image.source = Url { url, detail: None }`.

AMIO-6. Recognized `data:image/...;base64,...` URLs MUST become ordinary assistant `Image` nodes with `Image.source = Base64 { media_type, data }`.

AMIO-7. Non-image `data:` URLs and malformed Markdown image blocks MUST remain inside the text content unchanged.

AMIO-8. Extracted image nodes MUST be inserted immediately after the originating ordinary assistant text node, preserving original order.

AMIO-9. If removing Markdown image blocks leaves a text node empty, the transform MAY remove that text node.

AMIO-10. On streams where the downstream protocol can faithfully represent extracted image nodes incrementally, the transform MUST preserve pass-through timing by buffering only the ambiguous Markdown suffix required to disambiguate a candidate image block, emitting safe text deltas as soon as possible, and emitting image-node lifecycle events in source order once one full Markdown image block is recognized.

AMIO-11. Under the incremental path in AMIO-10, the transform MUST update terminal `NodeDone.node` and `ResponseDone.output` so the authoritative final flat node state contains the cleaned text nodes and inserted image nodes.

AMIO-12. If the selected downstream protocol cannot faithfully represent the incremental rewritten node lifecycle, the runtime MUST use the buffered synthetic stream path.

AMIO-13. If no Markdown image is extracted from an assistant text node, the transform MUST preserve every node field, including empty content, logprobs, signature, citations, ID, phase, and extras. This rule applies to non-stream output, `NodeDone`, and `ResponseDone`.

AMIO-14. If extraction changes text, the transform MUST clear its signature and logprobs because they describe the original bytes. It MUST preserve citations without answer ranges. For each citation with an answer range, it MUST discard a range that intersects removed Markdown. Otherwise, it MUST subtract the number of removed Unicode scalars before the range from both offsets. Source coordinates and citation extras MUST remain unchanged.

AMIO-15. A stream text node with header metadata or a delta carrying logprobs, signature, or citations MUST buffer that node's subsequent deltas until its terminal text is known. When no image is extracted, it MUST replay buffered deltas with their metadata, usage, and extras unchanged. When extraction changes text, it MUST emit rewritten content without stale text metadata and apply AMIO-14 to terminal citations. Metadata-free text retains AMIO-10's incremental path.


AOIM-1. `image_output_to_markdown` is response-phase only.

AOIM-2. Config MAY contain `template: string`.

AOIM-3. Raw placeholders are `{{src}}`, `{{url}}`, `{{media_type}}`, and `{{data}}`. Percent-encoded placeholders are `{{src_urlencoded}}`, `{{url_urlencoded}}`, `{{media_type_urlencoded}}`, and `{{data_urlencoded}}`.

AOIM-4. Placeholder resolution MUST follow these exact rules:
1. raw placeholders expand to literal values;
2. percent-encoded placeholders expand to percent-encoded UTF-8 bytes of the raw value;
3. for `Image.source = Url`, `src` and `url` both resolve to the source URL while `media_type` and `data` resolve to empty strings; and
4. for `Image.source = Base64`, `src` resolves to `data:{media_type};base64,{data}`, `url` resolves to the empty string, and `media_type` and `data` resolve to the underlying raw fields.

AOIM-5. If `template` is absent, the transform MUST render `![image]({url})` for URL-backed image nodes and `![image](data:{media_type};base64,{data})` for base64-backed image nodes.

AOIM-6. The transform MUST inspect only ordinary assistant `Image` nodes.

AOIM-7. The transform MUST append the rendered Markdown strings to assistant text output in source order.

AOIM-8. If an assistant text node already exists later in the same encoder-owned ordinary-node run, the rendered Markdown MUST append to the final such text node. Otherwise the transform MUST create one new trailing ordinary assistant `Text` node.

AOIM-9. The transform MUST NOT remove or rewrite the original image nodes.

AOIM-10. On pass-through streams, the transform MUST preserve pass-through timing and MAY apply only to terminal stream state by updating `NodeDone.node` and `ResponseDone.output`.

AOIM-11. If a request is already on the buffered synthetic path because of another matching response transform, the final transformed `UrpResponseV2` MUST produce downstream text deltas that include the appended Markdown.

AOIM-12. `image_output_to_markdown` alone MUST NOT force an otherwise pass-through stream onto the buffered synthetic path.

CAOI-1. `image_compress_output` is response-phase only.

CAOI-2. Config MAY contain:
- `max_edge_px` (integer, optional)
- `jpeg_quality` (integer, default `80`)
- `jpegxl_quality` (integer from `1` through `99`, default `90`)
- `jpegxl_effort` (integer from `1` through `10`, default `7`)
- `webp_quality` (integer from `1` through `100`, default `80`)
- `skip_if_smaller` (boolean, default `true`)
- `output_format` (`original`, `jpg`, `jpegxl_lossless`, `jpegxl`, `webp_lossless`, `webp`, or `png`; default `original`)

When `max_edge_px` is absent, the transform MUST preserve the decoded image dimensions. When it is present, it MUST be at least `1`, and the transform MUST resize the decoded image only when its width or height exceeds that value.

CAOI-3. On non-stream responses, the transform MUST inspect ordinary `Image` nodes with `role = assistant`, `ToolResultContent::Image` entries in `ToolResult` nodes, and complete JSON arguments of function `ToolCall` nodes in `response.output`. Tool-result and tool-call images follow CUMI-4a and the same source eligibility and preservation rules as request images.

CAOI-4. On stream responses, the transform MUST inspect:
1. `NodeDelta` image sources only when a preceding `NodeStart` for the same `node_index` has `header.type = image` and `header.role = assistant`;
2. complete JSON `NodeDelta::ToolCallArguments` values only when the matching `NodeStart` is a function `ToolCall`; incomplete argument fragments MUST remain unchanged;
3. `NodeDone.node` and `ResponseDone.output` ordinary `Image` nodes with `role = assistant`, function `ToolCall` arguments, and `ToolResultContent::Image` entries; and
4. no custom-tool freeform input or non-image tool content.
Terminal tool-call arguments MUST use the transformed complete value even when earlier fragments could not be transformed.

CAOI-5. Eligible image sources are:
1. `Image.source = Base64`; or
2. `Image.source = Url` whose `url` is a `data:<image-media-type>;base64,<payload>` URL.

CAOI-6. Non-`data:` URL sources MUST remain unchanged.

CAOI-7. If the media type is not decodable by the image codec stack, the node or delta MUST remain unchanged.

CAOI-8. Successful replacements MUST preserve source representation, tool-call JSON shape, typed metadata, and provider-specific fields under CUMI-7.

CAOI-9. The output format selection and encoding rules MUST be identical to CUMI-8 and CUMI-8a. The alpha-channel protection MUST apply to non-streaming images and all eligible streaming image sources.

CAOI-10. The cache key material and cache key algorithm MUST be identical to CUMI-9 and CUMI-10.

CAOI-11. Cache persistence, eviction, and failure isolation MUST apply equally to eligible ordinary, tool-result, and tool-call image sources and assistant image deltas.

### 4.9 `prompt_strip_anthropic_billing_header`

SABH-1. `prompt_strip_anthropic_billing_header` is request-phase only.

SABH-2. Config MUST be an empty object.

SABH-3. Supported scopes are `Provider`, `Global`, and `ApiKey`.

SABH-4. The transform MUST inspect only `Text` nodes whose role is `System` or `Developer`.

SABH-5. For each inspected text node, the transform MUST remove every line whose first non-whitespace characters are `x-anthropic-billing-header:`.

SABH-6. If an inspected text node has empty content after SABH-5, the transform MUST remove that node from `req.input`.

SABH-7. The transform MUST NOT modify user, assistant, tool-result, tool-call, image, audio, file, reasoning, refusal, provider-item, or control nodes.

SABH-8. The transform is idempotent.

### 4.10 `stream_split_sse_frames`

SSF-1. Phase: response only.

SSF-2. Config MAY contain `max_frame_length` as an integer. Default value is `131072`.

SSF-3. If a streaming request matches at least one enabled `stream_split_sse_frames` response rule, the runtime MUST keep the selected native downstream stream encoder path. The transform MUST NOT require or force the buffered synthetic stream path solely to split SSE frames.

SSF-4. The transform affects only downstream SSE emitted by Monoize.

SSF-5. Non-stream requests remain semantically unchanged.

SSF-6. The transform MUST preserve downstream protocol correctness for Responses, Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages SSE output.

SSF-7. The transform MUST split oversized string-bearing delta payloads into multiple smaller downstream SSE events of the same downstream protocol event kind, in original order, such that downstream concatenation reconstructs the original logical content. Split decisions MUST use the exact serialized downstream SSE `data:` line length after JSON string escaping and after adding the literal `data: ` prefix.

SSF-8. Eligible split targets include text deltas, reasoning deltas, opaque reasoning signature or encrypted deltas, and tool-argument deltas.

SSF-9. The runtime MUST NOT split inside a serialized JSON string literal by inserting raw SSE line breaks.

SSF-10. If a Responses synthetic stream snapshot event would exceed `max_frame_length` only because it duplicates content already emitted in prior delta events, the runtime MAY replace large duplicated text-bearing snapshot fields with protocol-valid empty values.

SSF-11. Sanitization under SSF-10 MUST preserve reconstructability from the emitted delta sequence and terminal events.

SSF-12. If `max_frame_length` is too small to encode even the minimal wrapper for one required downstream event, the runtime MAY emit that minimal unsplit event rather than fail the entire request.

SSF-13. The transform MUST preserve event order and MUST NOT change usage, finish reason, `call_id`, node role, node phase, or other typed metadata except for the duplicated snapshot text fields allowed by SSF-10.

### 4.11 `reasoning_effort_to_model_suffix`

REMS-1. Phase: request only.

REMS-2. Config MUST contain `rules`, a non-empty ordered array of objects with `pattern` and `suffix`.

REMS-3. The literal substring `{effort}` inside `suffix` MUST expand to the resolved effort value.

REMS-4. On apply:
1. read `request.reasoning.effort`;
2. if the effort is absent or not one of `none`, `minimum`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`, the transform MUST no-op;
3. otherwise iterate `rules` in order;
4. for the first matching rule, append the expanded suffix to `request.model`; and
5. stop after the first match.

REMS-5. The transform MUST NOT modify `request.reasoning`.

## 5. Routing and transform pipeline

PIPE-1. Non-stream and stream requests MUST execute in this order:
1. decode the downstream wire payload into URP v2;
2. resolve model suffix;
3. route to provider and channel using waterfall plus fail-forward;
4. set `request.model` to the selected upstream model name;
5. remove ProviderItems whose `origin_protocol` does not equal the selected upstream provider protocol under XSTRIP-9;
6. if required, perform cross-family nested passthrough stripping under XSTRIP-3 through XSTRIP-8;
7. unwrap any `mz2.` reasoning envelopes in `request.input` against the selected upstream provider type and upstream model under §7.2 of `spec/unified_responses_proxy.spec.md` (PR4c.6, PR4c.7, PR4c.8);
8. apply provider request-phase transforms;
9. apply global request-phase transforms configured in system settings;
10. apply API-key request-phase transforms;
11. encode URP v2 to the upstream wire payload using the selected upstream model name;
12. decode the upstream response or stream into URP v2;
13. wrap newly produced opaque encrypted reasoning payloads in `mz2.` envelopes under PR4c.3 through PR4c.5b of `spec/unified_responses_proxy.spec.md` when the API key has `reasoning_envelope_enabled = true`;
14. apply provider response-phase transforms;
15. apply global response-phase transforms configured in system settings;
16. apply API-key response-phase transforms; and
17. encode URP v2 to the downstream wire response using the original requested logical model name.

PIPE-1d. Step 7 of PIPE-1 MUST run before any request-phase transform observes `request.input`. Step 13 of PIPE-1 MUST run before any response-phase transform observes `response.output` or canonical URP v2 stream events. The runtime MUST NOT expose unwrapped raw encrypted reasoning payloads to request-phase transforms, and MUST NOT expose un-enveloped encrypted reasoning payloads to response-phase transforms. The runtime MUST wrap each preserved Responses `response.output_item.added.item.encrypted_content` snapshot before a response-phase transform observes its canonical item-level event state. For an incremental encrypted surface, the runtime MUST buffer raw fragments until it can produce the single complete envelope defined by `spec/urp-v2-flat-structure.spec.md` SACC-5b. A response-phase transform MUST observe no raw fragment and MUST observe at most one complete encrypted envelope for that canonical node lifecycle.

PIPE-1a. For streaming requests that satisfy STR-9, the runtime MAY call the upstream non-stream endpoint for that attempt, decode to `UrpResponseV2`, apply response transforms, and emit synthesized downstream stream events. The postcondition is that transformed content remains visible on the stream path even when upstream native streaming is bypassed.

PIPE-1b. Model identity split is exact:
1. the upstream model name sent to the provider is `request.model` after provider request-phase transforms; and
2. billing, logging, and downstream response `model` field MUST use the original requested logical model name.

PIPE-1c. Transform rule model matching MUST use the normalized logical model rather than temporary redirected upstream model names.

PIPE-2. API-key policy MUST support a default `max_multiplier` routing constraint and ordered transform rules.

PIPE-3. Provider configuration MUST support ordered transform rules.

PIPE-3a. System settings MUST support ordered global transform rules. The default global transform rule list MUST be empty.

PIPE-4. If request max multiplier is absent, the router MUST use the API-key max multiplier when configured.

## 6. Externally stable downstream safety constraints

SAFE-1. The transform system rewrite to flat URP v2 MUST preserve externally observable Responses safety constraints.

SAFE-2. For `/v1/responses`, downstream encoders and transforms MUST preserve observable response lifecycle, output-item lifecycle, content-part lifecycle, output ordering, addressing coordinates, item status transitions, and terminal `response.completed` ordering even though canonical internal storage is flat.

SAFE-3. `ResponseDone.output` is the only authoritative terminal flat state used to reconstruct final Responses output items.

SAFE-4. The transform system rewrite to flat URP v2 MUST preserve Anthropic Messages safety constraints.

SAFE-5. For `/v1/messages`, downstream encoders and transforms MUST preserve the exact event lifecycle `message_start -> content_block_* -> message_delta -> message_stop`, preserve block index semantics as final content positions, preserve cumulative usage semantics, and keep `tool_result` distinct from ordinary role-bearing content.

SAFE-6. The transform system rewrite to flat URP v2 MUST preserve OpenRouter-compatible Chat safety constraints.

SAFE-7. For `/v1/chat/completions`, downstream encoders and transforms MUST preserve OpenRouter-compatible reasoning behavior, including `reasoning_details`, plain-text reasoning fields when those exact downstream fields already exist, final usage chunk semantics, SSE comment compatibility, and chunk-shaped streaming error compatibility.

SAFE-8. Control nodes MUST NOT be emitted downstream as visible content. Their only normative downstream effect is envelope-level passthrough application by the next downstream encoder-owned consumable envelope.

## 7. Validity summary

VALID-1. A valid transform-visible URP v2 request or response uses flat top-level node sequences, not grouped message wrappers.

VALID-2. `ToolResult` remains a distinct top-level node type and MUST NOT be reclassified as an ordinary role-bearing node.

VALID-3. Control-node behavior is explicit only where stated in this specification. Otherwise control nodes are opaque sequence elements.

VALID-4. Response stream terminal state is authoritative. `ResponseDone.output` is the final flat node sequence.

VALID-5. If faithful incremental stream rewriting is not possible, buffered synthetic streaming remains allowed.
