# Channel/Provider Management (Dashboard) Specification

## 0. Status

- Product name: Monoize.
- Internal protocol name: `URP-Proto`.
- Scope: `/api/dashboard/providers*` APIs used by provider/channel management UI.
- Compatibility rule: this migration has no legacy API compatibility. Removed fields MUST NOT be accepted.

## 1. Data Model

### 1.1 Provider

A provider object MUST include:

- `id: string` (immutable, server-generated, 8-character random string from `[a-z0-9]`)
- `name: string`
- `enabled: boolean`
- `priority: integer` (lower value means earlier routing order)
- `max_retries: integer` (default `-1`)
- `channel_max_retries: integer` (default `0`)
- `channel_retry_interval_ms: integer` (default `0`)
- `circuit_breaker_enabled: boolean` (default `true`)
- `per_model_circuit_break: boolean` (default `false`)
- `channels: Channel[]`
- `transforms: TransformRuleConfig[]` (ordered, default empty)
- `api_type_overrides: ApiTypeOverride[]` (ordered, default empty). Each entry is `{ pattern: string, api_type: enum("responses","chat_completion","messages","gemini","openai_image","replicate") }`.
- `active_probe_enabled_override?: boolean | null`
- `active_probe_interval_seconds_override?: integer | null`
- `active_probe_success_threshold_override?: integer | null`
- `active_probe_model_override?: string | null`
- `request_timeout_ms_override?: integer | null`
- `extra_fields_whitelist?: string[] | null`
- `strip_cross_protocol_nested_extra?: boolean | null`
- `group_ids: string[]` (provider-level group ids for routing eligibility; stored non-empty, see `groups-registry.spec.md` GR-I2)
- `created_at: RFC3339`
- `updated_at: RFC3339`

CM-READ-1. Provider list, Provider detail, model-constrained routing, and active-probe candidate reads MUST return the persisted `strip_cross_protocol_nested_extra` value exactly. `true`, `false`, and `null` MUST remain distinct on every read path.

A provider object MUST NOT include `provider_type`.

### 1.2 Channel

A channel object MUST include:

- `id: string`
- `name: string`
- `provider_type: enum("responses","chat_completion","messages","gemini","openai_image","replicate")`
- `base_url: string`
- `api_key: string` (write-only: MUST NOT be returned by list/get APIs)
- `weight: integer >= 0`
- `enabled: boolean`
- `models: Record<string, { redirect: string | null, multiplier: string }>`

Runtime projection fields MAY be returned by list/get APIs:

- `_healthy: boolean`
- `_last_success_at: RFC3339 | null`
- `_health_status: enum("healthy","probing","unhealthy")`

Channel-level passive breaker override fields MAY be present:

- `passive_failure_count_threshold_override: integer? (>= 1)`
- `passive_window_seconds_override: integer? (>= 1)`
- `passive_cooldown_seconds_override: integer? (>= 1)`
- `passive_rate_limit_cooldown_seconds_override: integer? (>= 1)`

Channel-level active probe override fields MAY be present:

- `active_probe_enabled_override: boolean?`
- `active_probe_interval_seconds_override: integer? (>= 1)`
- `active_probe_success_threshold_override: integer? (>= 1)`
- `active_probe_model_override: string?`

Channel-level affinity override fields MAY be present:

- `affinity_enabled_override: boolean?`
- `affinity_idle_ttl_seconds_override: integer? (>= 1)`
- `affinity_failback_mode_override: enum("sticky","prefer_higher_priority")?`
- `affinity_failback_delay_seconds_override: integer? (>= 0)`

Channel egress proxy field MAY be present:

- `proxy_url: string | null`. `null`, absent, or empty means "follow global": the channel's upstream requests use the node-local proxy from `MONOIZE_UPSTREAM_PROXY_URL` (`primary-replica-deployment.spec.md` PX-series). A non-empty value is a custom absolute `http://` or `https://` proxy URL used only by this Channel's upstream requests.

Channel static upstream header map MAY be present:

- `extra_headers: Record<string, string> | null`. `null`, absent, or `{}` are equivalent and mean "no extra headers". Otherwise each entry is a static HTTP header injected into every upstream request issued for this Channel, applied after authentication and protocol-specific headers.

Channel automatic session affinity flag MAY be present:

- `session_affinity_auto: boolean | null`. `true` enables automatic session affinity. `false` disables it. `null` or absent selects the URL-based default in CM-AFF-0. When effective automatic session affinity is enabled, every proxied upstream request issued for this Channel MUST carry an `x-session-affinity` header per CM-AFF-1 through CM-AFF-2.

## 2. Invariants

CP-INV-1. `channels.length >= 1`.

CP-INV-2. At least one Channel MUST have a non-empty `models` object.

CP-INV-3. Every Channel model entry `multiplier` MUST be a base-10 decimal string with at most 9 fractional digits, MUST be representable by the server decimal type, and MUST satisfy `multiplier > 0`. Exponent notation, a leading `+`, `NaN`, and infinity are invalid. The server MUST parse, compare, persist, and return the multiplier without converting it through `f32` or `f64`.

CP-INV-3a. Read responses MUST return each multiplier as a canonical decimal string without exponent notation or trailing fractional zeroes. The canonical representation of one is `"1"`.

CP-INV-4. Every channel weight MUST satisfy `weight >= 0`.

CP-INV-5. Every channel `provider_type` and every `api_type_overrides[].api_type` MUST be one of `responses`, `chat_completion`, `messages`, `gemini`, `openai_image`, `replicate`.

CP-INV-6. Every `api_type_overrides[].pattern` MUST be a non-empty string.

CP-INV-7. Every returned `provider.group_ids` value MUST be trimmed, deduplicated preserving first-occurrence order, and reference existing groups at write time (`groups-registry.spec.md` GR-C1..GR-C3).

CP-INV-8. Channel model keys MUST be non-empty after trimming and unique within that Channel.

CP-INV-9. Provider MUST NOT contain a `models` field. Provider-level model selection, redirect, and multiplier state are obsolete and MUST NOT be accepted or returned.

CP-INV-10. A Channel MAY have an empty `models` object. The UI MUST warn. The Channel MUST NOT be eligible for any model route until at least one model entry exists.

CP-INV-11. Every non-null `affinity_idle_ttl_seconds_override` MUST be between `1` and `2147483647`, inclusive.

CP-INV-12. Every non-null `affinity_failback_delay_seconds_override` MUST be between `0` and `2147483647`, inclusive.

CP-INV-13. Every non-null `affinity_failback_mode_override` MUST equal `"sticky"` or `"prefer_higher_priority"`.

CP-INV-14. Every non-empty `proxy_url` MUST be an absolute URL with scheme `http` or `https`. Any other value MUST be rejected with HTTP 400 code `invalid_request`. `null`, absent, and empty are equivalent and mean follow-global.

CP-INV-15. Every non-null `extra_headers` value MUST satisfy all of the following; violations MUST be rejected with HTTP 400 code `invalid_request`:
- at most 16 entries;
- every key is trimmed non-empty, at most 128 characters, and consists only of HTTP field-name characters matching `[!#$%&'*+\-.^_\x60|~0-9A-Za-z]+`;
- keys are unique after lowercasing;
- no key equals, case-insensitively, one of `authorization`, `host`, `content-length`, `content-type`, `transfer-encoding`, `connection`, `keep-alive`, `upgrade`, `expect`, `te`, `trailer`;
- every value is at most 4096 characters and contains neither CR (`0x0D`) nor LF (`0x0A`).

CP-INV-15a. On persist, the server MUST trim keys and serialize the map as JSON with keys sorted ascending by byte order. An entry whose trimmed key is empty MUST cause rejection under CP-INV-15. Values MUST NOT be trimmed.

CM-AFF-0. A **direct Cloudflare Workers AI Channel** has a `base_url` that satisfies all of these conditions:
1. The URL parses successfully.
2. The URL scheme is `https`.
3. The URL host is exactly `api.cloudflare.com`.
4. After removal of one optional trailing slash, the URL path is exactly `/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai` or `/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/v1`, where `{account_id}` is non-empty.
5. The URL has no query and no fragment.

The Channel's effective automatic session affinity MUST use this order:
1. If `session_affinity_auto` is `true`, enable it.
2. If `session_affinity_auto` is `false`, disable it.
3. If `session_affinity_auto` is `null` or absent, enable it only for a direct Cloudflare Workers AI Channel.

CM-HDR-1. Every upstream request issued for a Channel (proxy traffic and the liveness probe of §3.8) MUST send the Channel's persisted `extra_headers` entries in addition to the authentication and protocol-specific headers. When an entry name collides with an authentication or protocol-specific header, the request MUST be rejected at configuration time by CP-INV-15 rather than silently overridden at runtime.

CM-AFF-1. If the Channel `extra_headers` contains an explicit `x-session-affinity` entry, that value MUST be sent verbatim and client passthrough (CM-AFF-1a), request-body identifiers (CM-AFF-1b), and automatic derivation (CM-AFF-2) MUST NOT run.

CM-AFF-1a. When effective automatic session affinity is enabled and CM-AFF-1 does not apply, and the incoming client request carries a session-affinity-style header, the gateway MUST pass that client value through as the upstream `x-session-affinity` header. The client headers are read in this order and the first present, non-empty one wins:
1. `session_id` (codex-style header; matched case-insensitively);
2. `session-id` (hyphenated alias; nginx default configs drop underscore header names);
3. `x-session-id`;
4. `x-session-affinity` (the header itself, sent by clients that already compute affinity).
The value MUST be trimmed, restricted to printable ASCII characters (`0x20..=0x7E`), and truncated to 128 characters. If nothing remains after restriction, the header is treated as absent and the rules below continue.

CM-AFF-1b. When effective automatic session affinity is enabled and neither CM-AFF-1 nor CM-AFF-1a produced a value, the gateway MUST use a stable conversation identifier from the decoded request. Scan the following sources in order and take the first present, non-empty value after the same printable-ASCII restriction and 128-character truncation as CM-AFF-1a:
1. `extra_body` keys `session_id`, `session`, `conversation_id`, `conversation`, `thread_id`, `thread`;
2. `extra_body.metadata` with the same keys as (1);
3. `extra_body.user_id`, then `extra_body.metadata.user_id`;
4. `req.user`.
A source value MAY be a JSON string or integer; other JSON types are skipped. The raw identifier string is used (not a `key:value` encoding) so a header `session_id` and a body `session_id` with the same uuid produce the same upstream header. `previous_response_id` MUST NOT be used: that field changes every Responses turn and would split one conversation across instances.

CM-AFF-2. When effective automatic session affinity is enabled and none of CM-AFF-1, CM-AFF-1a, or CM-AFF-1b produced a value, the gateway MUST derive the header value for each proxied request as follows:
1. If the upstream body contains a non-empty string `prompt_cache_key`, the value MUST be that string trimmed, restricted to printable ASCII characters (`0x20..=0x7E`), and truncated to 128 characters. If nothing remains after restriction, fall through to rule 2.
2. Otherwise the value MUST be `"mono-"` followed by the first 16 lowercase hex characters of the SHA-256 digest of the canonical JSON serialization (`serde_json`, key-sorted) of the object:
   - `instructions`: the decoded request `extra_body.instructions` value when present, else null;
   - `head`: an array of at most the first 2 decoded input nodes, each replaced by a canonical identity object that includes the node's kind, role when the node has a role, and content identity (text content; image/audio/file source; tool-call name and arguments; tool-result content). The canonical object MUST omit `id`, `extra_body`, `cache_control`, and any tool-definition array.
The derivation MUST NOT include `tools` or `functions`. It MUST be a pure function of `instructions` plus the first two input nodes: identical heads yield identical values; appending further input nodes MUST NOT change the value; adding, removing, or reordering tool definitions MUST NOT change the value.
When a decoded request is not available, the gateway MUST apply the same hash to the encoded upstream body using `instructions` (string or absent), `system` (when present), and the first at most 2 entries of `messages` else `input`, and MUST still omit `tools` and `functions`.

CM-AFF-3. Automatic session affinity applies only to proxied traffic. Liveness probes (§3.8) MUST NOT send derived values or client passthrough values; explicit static `extra_headers` entries continue to apply there under CM-HDR-1.

CM-AFF-4. When effective automatic session affinity is enabled and any of CM-AFF-1, CM-AFF-1a, CM-AFF-1b, or CM-AFF-2 produced a value for a proxied request, the gateway MUST record that exact value in `request_logs.session_affinity_value` on the request's terminal log row (`request-logs.spec.md` §1.1). Requests whose effective automatic session affinity is disabled, liveness probes, and requests that produced no value MUST store null.

Provider group routing semantics:

- A provider is eligible for a request when `provider.group_ids` overlaps the request's `effective_groups` (`database-provider-routing.spec.md` R-GRP-1).
- On create/update, the server MUST canonicalize and validate `group_ids` per `groups-registry.spec.md` GR-C1..GR-C3, and MUST store a canonicalized empty array as `[default_group_id]` (GR-I2).

### 3.4 Update provider

- Method/Path: `PUT /api/dashboard/providers/{provider_id}`
- Body: same schema as create except all fields are optional and `provider_type` is forbidden at provider level.
- `id` MUST NOT be accepted in the update body.
- `channels` is a full replacement when present. Each Channel `models` object is a full replacement for that Channel.
- `models` at Provider level is an unknown field and MUST be rejected.
- Channel `api_key` behavior:
  - If `api_key` is omitted or empty for an existing channel id, preserve the stored key.
  - If `api_key` is omitted or empty for a new channel id, reject with `400 invalid_request`.
  - If `api_key` is provided and non-empty, replace the stored key.
- Response: updated provider
- Errors: `404 not_found`, `400 invalid_request`

CP-UPD-1. After update, runtime health and affinity entries for every channel id in the pre-update or post-update provider MUST be removed.

CP-UPD-2. After update completes, in-flight work created from an older provider configuration MUST NOT recreate the removed runtime health or affinity entries.

### 3.5 Delete provider

- Method/Path: `DELETE /api/dashboard/providers/{provider_id}`
- Response: `{ "success": true }`
- Errors: `404 not_found`

CP-DEL-1. After delete, runtime health and affinity entries for all deleted provider channel ids MUST be removed.

### 3.6 Reorder providers

- Method/Path: `POST /api/dashboard/providers/reorder`
- Body: `{ "provider_ids": string[] }`
- Semantics: provider at index `i` MUST be assigned priority `i`
- Response: `{ "success": true }`
- Errors:
  - `400 invalid_request` if array is empty
  - `400 invalid_request` if ids are duplicated or missing existing providers

### 3.7 Fetch channel models

- Method/Path: `POST /api/dashboard/fetch-channel-models`
- Body: `{ "provider_type": ProviderType, "base_url": string, "api_key"?: string, "provider_id"?: string, "channel_id"?: string }`
- Semantics:
  - If `api_key` is present and non-empty after trimming, the request MUST use that key.
  - If `api_key` is omitted or empty, `provider_id` and `channel_id` MUST both be present.
  - If `api_key` is omitted or empty and `provider_id` plus `channel_id` identify an existing Channel, the request MUST use the stored Channel `api_key`.
  - If `api_key` is omitted or empty and no stored Channel key can be resolved, return `400 invalid_input`.
  - The request body `provider_type` and `base_url` are the source of truth for the upstream request. They MAY differ from the stored Channel values when the editor has unsaved changes.
  - For `responses`, `chat_completion`, `messages`, `openai_image`, and `replicate`, call `GET {base}/v1/models` with bearer authentication.
  - For `gemini`, call Gemini list models with `x-goog-api-key`.
  - Read both successful and non-successful upstream response bodies through the bounded discovery reader defined by RRB-UD1 through RRB-UD6 in `spec/runtime-resource-bounds.spec.md`.
  - Parse a successful upstream response as JSON only after the bounded reader returns the complete body.
  - Return unique model ids sorted ascending.
- Response: `{ "models": string[] }`
- Errors:
  - `502 upstream_discovery_response_too_large` when a declared or streamed upstream body exceeds `MONOIZE_UPSTREAM_DISCOVERY_MAX_BYTES`.
  - `502 upstream_fetch_failed` when the upstream request, bounded body read, upstream status, or JSON decode fails for another reason.

### 3.8 Test channel liveness

- Method/Path: `POST /api/dashboard/providers/{provider_id}/channels/{channel_id}/test`
- Body: `{ "model"?: string }`
- If `model` is provided, it MUST be a key in the Channel `models` object.
- If `model` is omitted, use the Channel active probe model override, then Provider active probe model override, then global probe model, then the first Channel model key in lexicographic order.
- The global probe model and request timeout MUST be read from one `monoize_runtime` snapshot. This endpoint MUST NOT read the settings database.
- The upstream probe model MUST be the selected Channel model entry `redirect` when non-empty, otherwise the logical model key.
- The effective API type is the first matching Provider `api_type_overrides[]` entry for the logical model, otherwise the Channel `provider_type`.
- Replicate channels MUST be rejected for active completion probes.
- On success, define the candidate health keys as the base Channel id and, when `per_model_circuit_break = true`, one `{channel_id}::{model}` key for each current Channel model key.
- On success, reset every existing candidate health entry to healthy. Candidate health keys that do not exist MUST NOT be inserted when at least one candidate entry exists.
- On success, when no candidate health entry exists and capacity remains, insert and reset only the base Channel health key. When capacity is full, do not insert an entry.
- A successful test MUST NOT inspect or mutate health-map keys outside the candidate set. Its health-map work MUST be `O(channel.models.length)` and independent of the number of global health entries.
- Response: `{ "success": boolean, "latency_ms": integer, "model": string, "error": string | null }`
- On probe failure, `error` MUST identify the upstream outcome rather than a generic sentence:
  - HTTP non-2xx: `upstream returned {status} {reason}: {body}` where `{status}` is the
    numeric status (e.g. `500`, `503`), `{reason}` is the canonical reason phrase when
    known (e.g. `Service Unavailable`), and `{body}` is the upstream response body
    truncated to at most 512 bytes. An empty body omits the `: {body}` suffix.
  - Transport/connection failure: `connection failed: {detail}` using the underlying
    client error text.
  - `error` MUST NOT be the undifferentiated string
    `upstream returned non-2xx status or connection failed`.

## 4. Security

CP-SEC-1. `api_key` MUST be accepted in create/update payloads.

CP-SEC-2. `api_key` MUST NOT be returned in any read response.

## 5. Dashboard Frontend Interaction

CP-FE-1. Provider card move, edit, and delete actions MUST be invokable with a single tap or click. Tooltip visibility MUST NOT be required before the action runs.

CP-FE-2. Provider card move, edit, and delete icon buttons MUST have a hit target of at least `44px` by `44px` below the `sm` breakpoint. They MAY use a smaller hit target at `sm` and wider breakpoints.

CP-FE-3. Native HTML drag-and-drop reordering of provider cards MUST be enabled only when the browser matches `(pointer: fine)`. On coarse-pointer devices, provider reordering MUST remain available through the move up and move down buttons.

CP-FE-4. While a provider child popup is open or is closing from a user action, the parent provider dialog MUST NOT treat that child popup interaction as an outside-click dismissal.

CP-FE-5. Saving a provider child editor popup MUST update the parent provider draft and close only that child popup. It MUST NOT open the parent provider unsaved-changes confirmation.

CP-FE-6. Saving from the provider unsaved-changes confirmation MUST invoke the provider create or update operation at most once for the same tap or click sequence. That same sequence MUST NOT reopen the unsaved-changes confirmation.

CP-FE-7. The null choice for `session_affinity_auto` MUST use a label that identifies URL-based automatic selection. It MUST NOT use the global-inheritance label used by unrelated nullable settings.
